"Paragraph: Universal remote
A universal remote is a remote control that can be programmed to operate various brands of one or more types of consumer electronics devices. Low-end universal remotes can only control a set number of devices determined by their manufacturer, while mid- and high-end universal remotes allow the user to program in new control codes to the remote. Many remotes sold with various electronic include universal remote capabilities for other types of devices, which allow the remote to control other devices beyond the device it came with. For example, a VCR remote may be programmed to operate various brands of televisions.

Paragraph: Remote control
In electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, a remote control can be used to operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.

Paragraph: Apple Remote
The Apple Remote is a remote control device released in or after October 2005 by Apple Inc. for use with a number of its products which use infrared capabilities. The device was originally designed to interact with the Front Row media program on the iSight iMac G5 and is compatible with some later desktop and portable Macintosh computers. The first three generations of Apple TV used the Apple Remote as their primary control mechanism. It has now been replaced with the Siri Remote in the fourth generation. Prior to the Apple Remote, Apple produced several nameless IR remotes for products such as the Macintosh TV, TV tuner expansion boards, and the PowerCD drive.

Paragraph: Siri Remote
The Siri Remote is a remote control device released in tandem with the 4th Generation Apple TV at an Apple Keynote Address by CEO Tim Cook on October 26, 2015 by Apple Inc. The Remote is designed specifically to work with the always-on Siri capable Apple TV. The device is a successor of the original Apple Remote. It is also compatible with the Apple TV 4K.

Paragraph: NetSupport Manager
NetSupport Manager is a Windows-centric cross-platform remote control software, allowing remote screen control and systems management from a Windows or Windows Mobile device of Windows, Mac, Linux, Solaris and Mobile devices. It was first released for DOS only networks in 1989. It supports thumbnail display of unlimited remote systems (since version 10), and allows navigation between remote systems in a manner similar to a KVM switch. Functionality includes file transfers, chat, and hardware/software inventory including software updates. Fewer features are supported for Linux and Mac clients. In 2012 NetSupport introduced new software versions allowing Remote Control from iOS and Android tablets and smartphones as well as a new Mac OS Control. Version 12 was released in October 2013, which extended platform support to include ChromeOS clients. Mobile Remote Control from iOS and Android was also extended with additional capabilities. All versions of NetSupport Manager require the pre-installation of the software on both the local (Control) and remote (Client) computers/devices prior to use.

Paragraph: Front Row (software)
Front Row is a discontinued media center software application for Apple's Macintosh computers and Apple TV for navigating and viewing video, photos, podcasts, and music from a computer, optical disc, or the Internet through a 10-foot user interface (similar to Windows Media Center and Kodi). The software relies on iTunes and iPhoto and is controlled by an Apple Remote or the keyboard function keys. The first version was released October 2005, with two major revisions since. Front Row was removed and discontinued in Mac OS X 10.7.

Paragraph: Apple Watch
Apple Watch (stylized as WATCH) is a line of smartwatches developed, designed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It incorporates fitness tracking and health-oriented capabilities with integration with iOS and other Apple products and services. The original generation of the device was available in four variants: Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch, Apple Watch Hermès, and Apple Watch Edition; each distinguished by different combinations of cases and first- or third-party interchangeable bands. Apple Watch relies on a wirelessly connected iPhone to perform many of its default functions such as calling and texting. It is compatible with the iPhone 5 or later models running iOS 8.2 or later, through the use of Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Announced by Apple CEO Tim Cook in September 2014, the device was released in April 24, 2015. The Apple Watch quickly became the best-selling wearable device with the supply of 4.2 million smartwatches in the second quarter of the 2015 fiscal year. The second generation of Apple Watch, released in September 2016, includes two tiers: Apple Watch Series 2 and Apple Watch Series 1, which includes the S1P chip, but is otherwise identical to the original. The Series 3 was announced at a presentation at Apple Park on September 12, 2017 and was released on September 22, 2017.

Paragraph: MacScan
MacScan is an anti-malware utility for Apple's Mac OS X developed by SecureMac. It is aimed at removing malware (including spyware, Trojan horses, keystroke loggers, and tracking cookies). It was the first anti-spyware program released for Mac OS X. In addition, the application scans for remote administration programs, like Apple Remote Desktop, allowing users to verify that such programs are installed only with their authorization.

Paragraph: Trainmaster Command Control
Trainmaster Command (TMCC) is Lionel's electronic control system for O scale 3-rail model trains and toy trains that mainly ran from 1994 to 2006. Conceptually it is similar to Digital Command Control (DCC), the industry's open standard used by HO scale and other 2-rail DC trains. It has one advantage over DCC, in that TMCC-equipped locomotives can run simultaneously with non-TMCC locomotives and Lionel Legacy engines as well as LionChief and LionChief Plus equipped locomotives. The latter require a dedicated remote controller. MTH Corporation's DCS controller can be configured to control TMCC locomotives, and all four systems (TMCC, Legacy, LionChief/LionChief+ and DCS) can be operated on the same track simultaneously. Each simply requires a constant track voltage (18 volts). TMCC/Legacy ""broadcasts"" it's signal to the antenna on the locomotives which listen for signals that first identify the particular locomotive by number and then it issues given commands as to speed, direction, sounds, lighting and other features. DCS performs similar functions but transmits a carrier over the rails which are picked up through the locomotive's electrical pickup contacts. While TMCC/Legacy and DCS remote controls relay operator commands to a device that transmits them to the train (Command Base or Track Interface Unit), LionChief/LionChief+ also issue remote control commands but the remote and locomotive are married and each locomotive requires a separate remote control. This system requires no additional wiring as the control is directly ""narrowcast"" to the locomotive in the same way as a television remote control or garage door opener functions. In 2017, Lionel released a universal remote for LionChief+ that will learn addresses for up to three locos at a time, simplifying the operation of multiple trains.

"Paragraph: The Beatles
The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous popularity first emerged as ""Beatlemania"", and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.

"Paragraph: Cinizasaurus
""Cinizasaurus"" is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur. The remains, NMMNH P-18400, consist of a tibia, vertebrae, and fragments, and came from the ? late Carnian-age Upper Triassic Bluewater Creek Member of the Chinle Formation, near Fort Wingate. Andrew Heckert, in his unpublished thesis, proposed the name ""Cinizasaurus hunti"" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauriformes.

Paragraph: Sphaerotholus
Sphaerotholus is a genus of pachycephalosaurid dinosaur from the Upper Cretaceous of the western United States and Canada. To date, three species have been described: the type species, ""S. goodwini"", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; ""S. buchholtzae"", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and ""S. edmontonense"", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada. The etymology of ""Sphaerotholus"" is a combination of the Greek ""sphaira"", meaning ""ball"", and ""tholos"", meaning ""dome"", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull. The survival of ""Sphaerotholus"" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution. Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: ""Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node."" ""Sphaerotholus"" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur.

Paragraph: Oryctodromeus
Oryctodromeus (meaning ""digging runner"") was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur. Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago. A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, ""Oryctodromeus"" is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior.

Paragraph: Cryptoraptor
""Cryptoraptor"" (meaning ""secret thief"") is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur. The remains, NMMNH P-17375, consist of a fragmentary skeleton including vertebrae, a pubis, and parts of the thigh bones. This specimen came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation in Quay County. Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name ""Cryptoraptor lockleyi"" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauria.

Paragraph: Comanchesaurus
""Comanchesaurus"" is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur. The remains, NMMNH P-4569, consist of a partial skeleton including vertebral centra and hindlimb bones, and came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation of Guadalupe County. Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name ""Comanchesaurus kuesi"" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors found the material to belong to a ""possible indeterminate saurischian"".

Paragraph: McFarland, USA

Paragraph: Dinosaur (film)
Dinosaur is a 2000 American CGI animated adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation and The Secret Lab and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is the 39th Disney animated feature film and Disney's The Secret Lab computer animated feature, though it is not officially labeled as one of the animated classics in the United Kingdom, where ""The Wild"" (2006) is included in the canon instead.

Paragraph: Fruitadens
Fruitadens is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur. The name means ""Fruita tooth"", in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found. It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado. ""Fruitadens"" is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight. It is interpreted as an omnivore and represents one of the latest-surviving heterodontosaurids.

Paragraph: Dakotadon
Dakotadon is a genus of iguanodont dinosaur from the Barremian-age Lower Cretaceous Lakota Formation of South Dakota, USA, known from a partial skull. It was first described in 1989 as ""Iguanodon lakotaensis"", by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest that """"I."" lakotaensis"" was more basal than ""I. bernissartensis"", and related to ""Theiophytalia"", but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of ""I. bernissartensis"". Gregory S. Paul, working on a revision of iguanodont species, gave ""I."" ""lakotaensis"" its own genus (""Dako","Paragraph: Cinizasaurus

To date, three species have been described: the type species, ""S. goodwini"", from the Den-na-zin Member of the Kirtland Formation (Late Campanian) of San Juan County, New Mexico, USA; ""S. buchholtzae"", from the Hell Creek Formation (Late Maastrichtian) of western Carter County, Montana, USA; and ""S. edmontonense"", from the Horseshoe Canyon Formation of Alberta, Canada. The etymology of ""Sphaerotholus"" is a combination of the Greek ""sphaira"", meaning ""ball"", and ""tholos"", meaning ""dome"", and is a reference to the characteristically dome-shaped pachycephalosaurian skull. The survival of ""Sphaerotholus"" from the Campanian of New Mexico to the end of the Maastrichtian of Montana demonstrates that this taxon had both a relatively long duration (approximately 7-8 million years) and a widespread distribution. Williamson and Carr, who first described the genus in 2002, diagnose it as follows: ""Differs from all other pachycephalosaurids where known in the possession of a parietosquamosal bar that decreases in depth laterally as seen in caudal view and is bordered by a single row of nodes and one lateroventral corner node."" ""Sphaerotholus"" is considered a highly derived pachycephalosaur.

Paragraph: Oryctodromeus
Oryctodromeus (meaning ""digging runner"") was a genus of small ornithopod dinosaur. Fossils are known from the middle Cretaceous Blackleaf Formation of southwestern Montana and the Wayan Formation of southeastern Idaho, USA, both of the Cenomanian stage, roughly 95 million years ago. A member of the small, presumably fast-running herbivorous family Thescelosauridae, ""Oryctodromeus"" is the first dinosaur published that shows evidence of burrowing behavior.

Paragraph: Cryptoraptor
""Cryptoraptor"" (meaning ""secret thief"") is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a dinosaur. The remains, NMMNH P-17375, consist of a fragmentary skeleton including vertebrae, a pubis, and parts of the thigh bones. This specimen came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation in Quay County. Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name ""Cryptoraptor lockleyi"" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors could only assign the material to Archosauria.

Paragraph: Comanchesaurus
""Comanchesaurus"" is an informal name for fossilized remains from the Late Triassic of New Mexico that were initially interpreted as belonging to a theropod dinosaur. The remains, NMMNH P-4569, consist of a partial skeleton including vertebral centra and hindlimb bones, and came from the Norian-age Upper Triassic Bull Canyon Formation of Guadalupe County. Adrian Hunt, in his unpublished dissertation, proposed the name ""Comanchesaurus kuesi"" for the specimen, but the name was never adopted, and was first referred to in the scientific literature in a 2007 redescription of Late Triassic North American material thought to belong to dinosaurs (Nesbitt, Irmis, and Parker, 2007). In the redescription, the authors found the material to belong to a ""possible indeterminate saurischian"".

Paragraph: Fruitadens
Fruitadens is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur. The name means ""Fruita tooth"", in reference to Fruita, Colorado (USA), where its fossils were first found. It is known from partial skulls and skeletons from at least four individuals of differing biological ages, found in Tithonian (Late Jurassic) rocks of the Morrison Formation in Colorado. ""Fruitadens"" is the smallest known ornithischian dinosaur, with young adults estimated at 65 to in length and 0.5 to in weight.

It was first described in 1989 as ""Iguanodon lakotaensis"", by David B. Weishampel and Philip R. Bjork. Its assignment has been controversial. Some researchers suggest that """"I."" lakotaensis"" was more basal than ""I. bernissartensis"", and related to ""Theiophytalia"", but David Norman has suggested that it was a synonym of ""I. bernissartensis"". Gregory S. Paul, working on a revision of iguanodont species, gave ""I."" ""lakotaensis"" its own genus (""Dako","Which came out first, Dinosaur or McFarland, USA",Dinosaur

The trend of post-award failure has garnered the attention of the mainstream media. Talk of a curse in relation to bowl results was particularly prevalent from 2003 to 2008, when six Heisman Trophy winners compiled a cumulative 1–5 bowl game record, and five of those six led number one ranked teams into the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) National Championship Game as favorites (Heisman Trophy winners, including Reggie Bush, who gave back his Heisman Trophy, are 4–8 overall in the BCS National Championship Game and College Football Playoff National Championship, although prior to 2009 they were 1–6). Additionally, the Heisman curse asserts that in most cases a Heisman winner will have either a poor career in the National Football League (NFL), or in fact not even see such a football career at all. Although many Heisman winners have not enjoyed success at the professional level, including players like Matt Leinart, Andre Ware, Jason White, Rashaan Salaam, Eric Crouch, Ty Detmer, Troy Smith and Gino Torretta, proponents of the ""curse"" rarely cite highly successful players such as Barry Sanders, Charles Woodson, Eddie George, Tim Brown, Bo Jackson, Marcus Allen, Earl Campbell, and Tony Dorsett among the notables.

Lunin spent time in Finnish jails, three different prisons in Siberia, and lived on a farm under the watchful eye of the government during his life as an exile. Known for keeping good spirits and maintaining a firm defiance of autocratic rule, Lunin was eventually imprisoned again for writing in ""opposition"" to the Russian government, and lived out the rest of his life in a cell.

Paragraph: Ted Kubiak
Theodore Rodger Kubiak (born May 12, 1942) is a former switch-hitting infielder for the Kansas City Athletics, the Oakland Athletics, the Milwaukee Brewers, the St. Louis Cardinals, the Texas Rangers, and the San Diego Padres. He was a member of the Oakland Athletics teams that won three World Series in a row (1972–74). Kubiak still holds the Brewers' record for most RBIs in a single game, seven (later equalled by Jose Hernandez and Richie Sexson), which he set at Boston on July 18, 1970, the team's first year in Milwaukee. The record is all the more remarkable given that Kubiak was not known for his batting.

Paragraph: Treaty of Taipei
The Sino-Japanese Peace Treaty (Chinese: 中日和平條約 ), commonly known as the Treaty of Taipei (), was a peace treaty between Japan and the Republic of China (ROC) signed in Taipei, Taiwan on April 28, 1952, and took effect on August 5 the same year, marking the formal end of the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–45). This treaty was necessary, because neither the Republic of China nor the People's Republic of China was invited to sign the Treaty of San Francisco due to disagreements by other countries as to which government was the legitimate government of China during and after the Chinese Civil War. Under pressure from the United States, Japan signed a separate peace treaty with the Republic of China to bring the war between the two states to a formal end with a victory for the ROC. Although the ROC itself was not a participant in the San Francisco Peace Conference due to the resumption of the Chinese Civil War after 1945, this treaty largely corresponds to that of San Francisco. In particular, the ROC waived service compensation to Japan in this treaty with respect to Article 14(a).1 of the San Francisco Treaty.

"Paragraph: Savilian Professor of Geometry
The position of Savilian Professor of Geometry was established at the University of Oxford in 1619. It was founded (at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy) by Sir Henry Savile, a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College, reacting to what has been described by one 20th-century mathematician as ""the wretched state of mathematical studies in England"" at that time. He appointed Henry Briggs as the first professor. Edward Titchmarsh (professor 1931–63) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry, and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment, although the title of the chair was not changed. The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford since the late 19th century. Before then, for over 175 years until the middle of the 19th century, the geometry professors had an official residence adjoining the college in New College Lane.

Paragraph: Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics
The Sadleirian Professorship of Pure Mathematics (originally in the statutes and for the first two professors, Sadlerian) is a professorship in pure mathematics within the DPMMS at the University of Cambridge. It was founded on a bequest from Lady Mary Sadleir for lectureships for the full and clear explication and teaching that part of mathematical knowledge commonly called algebra. She died in 1706 and lectures began in 1710 but eventually these failed to attract undergraduates. In 1860 the foundation was used to establish the professorship. On 10 June 1863 Arthur Cayley was elected with the statutory duty to explain and teach the principles of pure mathematics, and to apply himself to the advancement of that science. The stipend attached to the professorship was modest although it improved in the course of subsequent legislation.

The oldest professorship is the Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy. The three science professorships were created following the recommendation of the University Commission in 1857, in recognition of William of Waynflete's lifetime support of science. The professorships are the Waynflete Professor of Chemistry, the Waynflete Professor of Physiology, and the Waynflete Professor of Pure Mathematics.

The Mayhew Prize is a prize awarded annually by the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge to the student showing the greatest distinction in applied mathematics, primarily for courses offered by DAMTP, but also for some courses offered by the Statistical Laboratory, in the CASM examinations, also known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. This includes only about half of all students taking the CASM examinations, since the rest are taking mainly pure mathematics courses, and so the winner of the Mayhew Prize is not equivalent to obtaining the highest mark on the CASM examinations. There is currently no equivalent prize for pure mathematics, due to the absence of funds.

The position of Savilian Professor of Geometry was established at the University of Oxford in 1619. It was founded (at the same time as the Savilian Professorship of Astronomy) by Sir Henry Savile, a mathematician and classical scholar who was Warden of Merton College, Oxford, and Provost of Eton College, reacting to what has been described by one 20th-century mathematician as ""the wretched state of mathematical studies in England"" at that time. He appointed Henry Briggs as the first professor. Edward Titchmarsh (professor 1931–63) said when applying that he was not prepared to lecture on geometry, and the requirement was removed from the duties of the post to enable his appointment, although the title of the chair was not changed. The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial fellowships at New College, Oxford since the late 19th century. Before then, for over 175 years until the middle of the 19th century, the geometry professors had an official residence adjoining the college in New College Lane.

Paragraph: Sadleirian Professor of Pure Mathematics
The Sadleirian Professorship of Pure Mathematics (originally in the statutes and for the first two professors, Sadlerian) is a professorship in pure mathematics within the DPMMS at the University of Cambridge. It was founded on a bequest from Lady Mary Sadleir for lectureships for the full and clear explication and teaching that part of mathematical knowledge commonly called algebra. She died in 1706 and lectures began in 1710 but eventually these failed to attract undergraduates. In 1860 the foundation was used to establish the professorship. On 10 June 1863 Arthur Cayley was elected with the statutory duty to explain and teach the principles of pure mathematics, and to apply himself to the advancement of that science. The stipend attached to the professorship was modest although it improved in the course of subsequent legislation.

Paragraph: Mayhew Prize
The Mayhew Prize is a prize awarded annually by the Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge to the student showing the greatest distinction in applied mathematics, primarily for courses offered by DAMTP, but also for some courses offered by the Statistical Laboratory, in the CASM examinations, also known as Part III of the Mathematical Tripos. This includes only about half of all students taking the CASM examinations, since the rest are taking mainly pure mathematics courses, and so the winner of the Mayhew Prize is not equivalent to obtaining the highest mark on the CASM examinations. There is currently no equivalent prize for pure mathematics, due to the absence of funds.

"Paragraph: Waste management law
Waste management laws<section begin=overview /> govern the transport, treatment, storage, and disposal of all manner of waste, including municipal solid waste, hazardous waste, and nuclear waste, among many other types. Waste laws are generally designed to minimize or eliminate the uncontrolled dispersal of waste materials into the environment in a manner that may cause ecological or biological harm, and include laws designed to reduce the generation of waste and promote or mandate waste recycling. Regulatory efforts include identifying and categorizing waste types and mandating transport, treatment, storage, and disposal practices. <section end=overview />

Paragraph: Business waste
Business (or commercial and industrial) waste – cover the commercial waste and industrial waste types .

Paragraph: Shikashika
Shikashika is a shaved ice drink made from glacier ice in Peru and Bolivia. In some rural communities, the extraction and sale of ice continues to be a primary natural resource for local economies. Ice merchants extract the blocks with an axe by hand and transport them down from the mountains atop mules. The unit of sale is usually an ice block weighing approximately 40 kilos which is sold to Shikashika vendors. Each block sells for approximately 17 USD. In turn, Shikashika is sold for approximately 15 cents in plastic bags with colorful sweet syrups at Andean festivals and on market day. The word Shikashika is onomatopeia from the Amerindian language Quechua. An alternative word for Shikashika in Spanish is ""raspadilla.""

Paragraph: Composite liner
Disposing trash on Earth mainly comes in three ways: littering, incinerating, and storing in it the many landfills we have around the world. With today’s landfills, there are very constructed contaminate structures. These systems are designed to help keep solid waste from becoming too uncontained and uncontrolled from the environment and the impact it could have on the health of humans. The purpose of having a liner system within a landfill is mainly to isolate everything within the landfill from the environment and protect it from contaminating the contents of the soil and especially the water within the ground. These liners are engineered to create a physical barrier between the garbage within the landfill, the ground, and the environment, in order to separate the liquid contaminate (leachate) so that it can go to a treatment facility. There are different types of these landfill sites for the different types of solid wastes which society creates and leaves behind. There are certain levels of harmfulness in which the different types of trash have; therefore, there are different types of liner systems which are required for these different types of disposal sites. The first type is single liner-systems. These systems usually are put within landfills which mostly hold construction rubble. These landfills are not meant to hold the disposal of harmful liquid wastes such as paint, tar, or any other type of liquid garbage that can easily seep through a single liner system. The second type is double-liner systems. These systems are usually found in municipal solid waste landfills as well all hazardous waste landfills. The first part is constructed to collect the leachate while the second layer is engineered to be a leak-detection system to ensure that no contaminates leak into the ground and contaminate everything.

Paragraph: Gerontion

Alfred Prufrock"" and ""The Waste Land"", and other works published by Eliot in the early part of his career, '""Gerontion"" discusses themes of religion, sexuality, and other general topics of modernist poetry.

Paragraph: Household hazardous waste
Household hazardous waste (HHW), sometimes called retail hazardous waste or ""home generated special materials', is post-consumer waste which qualifies as hazardous waste when discarded. It includes household chemicals and other substances for which the owner no longer has a use, such as consumer products sold for home care, personal care, automotive care, pest control and other purposes. These products exhibit many of the same dangerous characteristics as fully regulated hazardous waste due to their potential for reactivity, ignitability, corrosivity, toxicity, or persistence. Examples include drain cleaners, oil paint, motor oil, antifreeze, fuel, poisons, pesticides, herbicides and rodenticides, fluorescent lamps, lamp ballasts, smoke detectors, medical waste, some types of cleaning chemicals, and consumer electronics (such as televisions, computers, and cell phones).

A chemical hazardous waste is a solid, liquid, or gaseous material that displays either a “Hazardous Characteristic” or is specifically “listed” by name as a hazardous waste. There are four characteristics chemical wastes may have to be considered as hazardous. These are Ignitability, Corrosivity, Reactivity, and Toxicity. This type of hazardous waste must be categorized as to its identity, constituents, and hazards so that it may be safely handled and managed. Chemical waste is a broad term and encompasses many types of materials. Consult the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), Product Data Sheet or Label for a list of constituents. These sources should state whether this chemical waste is a waste that needs special disposal.

If challenged, the chief and challenger would face off in a duel in which the winner would become chief and the loser would be eliminated from the competition. The final twist of the season was that of the ""Finalist Island"". Introduced in a challenge immediately preceding the merge, contestants would compete in a series of duels in which the winner would earn a spot on Finalist Island.

The major twist this season is that the contestants have been divided into tribes with half of each tribe being ""Masters"" and the other half being ""Slaves"". The contestants individual statuses were determined in a challenge they took part in before they were divided into tribes. The twelve members of each gender competed in a challenge against each other with the five winners being the masters of their tribe and each getting to pick one of the seven challenge losers from the other tribe as their slave. Through the slave selection process four contestants, Anja Balle, Gitte Behrendt, Vincent Muir, and Hector Nielsen, were eliminated and sent to ""Utopia"" to compete against each other as well as future eliminated contestants in order to earn a spot back in the game. Following the elimination, the ""Tenga"" and ""Minang"" tribes were formed with the Minang tribe being composed of the female winners and their slaves and the Tenga tribe of the male winners and their slaves. In episode 2, a tribal swap took place in which most of the contestants swapped tribes. In episode 3, no elimination took place due to Ali Ghiace's voluntary exit. Also in episode 3, it was revealed that, like last year, there is a mole competing in the game. With this news came that of the mole being the only person eligible to vote for two people at the third tribal council. In episode 5, both tribes competed in an elimination competition which would lead to players from each tribe being eliminated. Ultimately, it Maiken Andersen and Bjørn Lambertsen from Minang and Ann Applegren from Tenga who lost the challenge and were eliminated and sent to Utopia. In episode 9, the two tribes merged and five contestants from Utopia (Anja Balle, Diana Andersen, Germaine Nielsen, Hector Nielsen, and Reda Zamzam) returned to the game. In episode 10, Germaine lost a challenge and was eliminated. In episode 11, Anja and Reda were sent to Utopia where Anja lost a duel and was eliminated. In episode 13, all Utopia contestants competed in a duel which Hans ""HC"" Nørager lost and was eliminated. In episode 14, the recently voted out Gitte Benherdt along with all of the remaining Utopia residents competed in the final duel of the season for a spot in the final four. Ultimately, Hans Ravnholt won the duel while the others were eliminated in the following order, Gitte Behrendt, Diana Andersen, Jens Bach, Mette Egeberg, Henriette Nielsen, Hector Nielsen, and finally Jakob Jensen.

As a major twist this season, during the pre-merge portion of the game when a contestant was voted out they would move to a secret island where they would compete against two other contestants to remain in the game. The two contestants left on the secret island following the final duel, Elena Sinkevitch and Markku Markkanen, joined the other members of the merge tribe. The contestants were then divided up into two tribes known as ""Goal"" and ""Texas"". When it came time for the final four, the contestants took part in the infamous ""plank"" competition in which Jasna Preselj was eliminated and Markku Markkanen advanced to the final two. The other two contestants then took part in one more challenge in which Mira Jantunen won and advanced to the final two while Elena Sinkevitch was eliminated. The final two then took part in a duel which Mira Jantunen won and earned an extra jury vote for herself. Along with this, Mira also won the audience's jury vote.

The two contestants left on the secret island following the final duel, Elena Sinkevitch and Markku Markkanen, joined the other members of the merge tribe. The contestants were then divided up into two tribes known as ""Goal"" and ""Texas"". When it came time for the final four, the contestants took part in the infamous ""plank"" competition in which Jasna Preselj was eliminated and Markku Markkanen advanced to the final two. The other two contestants then took part in one more challenge in which Mira Jantunen won and advanced to the final two while Elena Sinkevitch was eliminated.

"Paragraph: Alien Intelligence (Palladium Books)
In the various game settings of Palladium Books, Alien Intelligences are fictional, vastly powerful beings of unknown origin that are stated to be a combination of equal parts spirit, magical energy, and physical flesh. They are said to exist on different planes of existence simultaneously, and in the Palladium hierarchy of powers, most Alien Intelligences, apart from the Vampire Intelligences, are more powerful than the mightiest Gods in Palladium. In fact, some of the most powerful Gods of the Palladium Megaverse were themselves spawned by the Alien Intelligences.

Paragraph: Old Ones (Palladium Books)
The Old Ones (sometimes referred to in Palladium Books publications as the Great Old Ones or the Unnameable Beings) are a fictional race of Alien Intelligences within the megaversal setting of Palladium Books' game module PFRPG. The Old Ones are the most powerful forces ever to have existed in the various Palladium game settings, and their power dwarfs that of 'ordinary' Alien Intelligences, beings which are in general far more powerful than the gods themselves.

Paragraph: Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)
In the Buffyverse, the Old Ones are the extremely powerful, pure-breed demons that once dominated Earth before humankind appeared. Illyria is one of these demons (though its real form was revealed only in an illustration) while it's more than likely that Jasmine and her kind (The Powers That Be) ascended to their higher plane because of the growing malevolence of these warring demons. It's also possible that the Powers that Be were part of the same race but shared a different philosophy than the other Old Ones.

Paragraph: Scaphyglottis
Scaphyglottis is a genus of orchids native to Mexico, Central America, northern South America and parts of the Caribbean. The current concept of this genus is the result of combining several genera which have been described at various times. The concept is characterized by the growth habit: not only are new pseudobulbs added at the base of the old ones (as is typical of sympodial orchids), but new pseudobulbs also grow at the apices of the old ones. Many species are quite similar and difficult to distinguish, but some are clearly distinct. A few have showy colors. The genus comprises nearly 70 species.

Paragraph: Cthulhu Mythos deities
H. P. Lovecraft created a number of fictional deities throughout the course of his literary career, including the ""Great Old Ones"" and the ""Elder Things"", with sporadic references to other miscellaneous deities (e.g. Nodens) whereas the ""Outer Gods"" are a later creation of other prolific writers such as August Derleth, who was credited with formalizing the ""Cthulhu Mythos"".

Paragraph: Fall of Cthulhu
Fall of Cthulhu is a 2007 American comic book series, written by Michael Alan Nelson and published in 2007 by Boom! Studios. Creatively influenced by H.P.

The most powerful of these warp entities are those known as the Chaos Gods, also sometimes referred to as the Dark Gods, Ruinous Powers, or the Powers of Chaos. Similarities exist between the Warhammer idea of Chaos and the concept of Chaos from Michael Moorcock's Elric saga, which also influenced D&D's alignment system. Further similarities can be seen with the godlike extradimensional Great Old Ones of horror writer H. P. Lovecraft's stories.

"Paragraph: Black hole bomb
A black hole bomb is the name given to a physical effect utilizing how a bosonic field impinging on a rotating black hole can be amplified through superradiant scattering. An additional condition which must be met is that the field must have a rest mass different from zero. The scattered wave will then be reflected back and forth between the mass term and the black hole becoming amplified on each reflection. The growth of the field is asserted to be exponential and unstable. The mechanism by which the black hole bomb functions is called superradiant instability.

Paragraph: V404 Cygni
V404 Cygni is a microquasar and a binary system consisting of a black hole with a mass of about and an early K companion star of mass slightly smaller than the Sun in the constellation of Cygnus. The star and the black hole orbit each other every at fairly close range. Due to their proximity and the intense gravity of the black hole, the companion star loses mass to an accretion disk around the black hole and ultimately to the black hole itself.

Paragraph: Ergosphere
The ergosphere is a region located outside a rotating black hole's outer event horizon. Its name was proposed by Remo Ruffini and John Archibald Wheeler during the Les Houches lectures in 1971 and is derived from the Greek word ""ergon"", which means ""work"". It received this name because it is theoretically possible to extract energy and mass from this region. The ergosphere touches the event horizon at the poles of a rotating black hole and extends to a greater radius at the equator. With a low spin of the central mass the shape of the ergosphere can be approximated by an oblated spheroid, while with higher spins it resembles a pumpkin-shape. The equatorial (maximum) radius of an ergosphere corresponds to the Schwarzschild radius of a non-rotating black hole; the polar (minimum) radius can be as little as half the Schwarzschild radius (the radius of a non-rotating black hole) in the case that the black hole is rotating maximally (at higher rotation rates the black hole could not have formed).

Paragraph: Extreme mass ratio inspiral
In astrophysics, an extreme mass ratio inspiral (EMRI) is the orbit of a relatively light object around a much heavier (by a factor 10,000 or more) object, that gradually decays due the emission of gravitational waves. Such systems are likely to be found in the centers of galaxies, where stellar mass compact objects, such as stellar black holes and neutron stars, may be found orbiting a supermassive black hole. In the case of a black hole in orbit around another black hole this is an extreme mass ratio binary black hole. The term EMRI is sometimes used as a shorthand to denote the emitted gravitational waveform as well as the orbit itself.

Paragraph: M33 X-7
M33 X-7 is a black hole binary system in the galaxy M33. The system is made up of a stellar mass black hole and a companion star. M33 X-7 is the largest known stellar black hole with an estimated mass of 15.65 times that of the Sun (M ). The total mass of the system is estimated to be around 85.7 M , which would make it the most massive black hole binary system.

Paragraph: Membrane paradigm
In black hole theory, the black hole membrane paradigm is a simplified model, useful for visualising and calculating the effects predicted by quantum mechanics for the exterior physics of black holes, without using quantum-mechanical principles or calculations. It models a black hole as a thin, classically radiating surface (or membrane) at or vanishingly close to the black hole's event horizon. This approach to the theory of black holes was created by Kip S. Thorne, R. H. Price and D. A. Macdonald.

Paragraph: De Sitter–Schwarzschild metric
In general relativity, the de Sitter–Schwarzschild solution describes a black hole in a causal patch of de Sitter space. Unlike a flat-space black hole, there is a largest possible de Sitter black hole, which is the Nariai spacetime. The Nariai limit has no singularities, the cosmological and black hole horizons have the same area, and they can be mapped to each other by a discrete reflection symmetry in any causal patch.

Paragraph: Penrose process
The Penrose process (also called Penrose mechanism) is a process theorised by Roger Penrose wherein energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole. That extraction is made possible because the rotational energy of the black hole is located not inside the event horizon of the black hole, but on the outside of it in a region of the Kerr spacetime called the ergosphere, a region in which a particle is necessarily propelled in locomotive concurrence with the rotating spacetime. All objects in the ergosphere become dragged by a rotating spacetime. In the process, a lump of matter enters into the ergosphere of the black hole, and once it enters the ergosphere, it is forcibly split into two parts. For example, the matter might be made of two parts that separate by firing an explosive or rocket which pushes its halves apart. The momentum of the two pieces of matter when they separate can be arranged so that one piece escapes from the black hole (it ""escapes to infinity""), whilst the other falls past the event horizon into the black hole. With careful arrangement, the escaping piece of matter can be made to have greater mass-energy than the original piece of matter, and the infalling piece has negative mass-energy. Although momentum is conserved the effect is that more energy can be extracted than was originally provided, the difference being provided by the black hole itself. In summary, the process results in a slight decrease in the angular momentum of the black hole, which corresponds to a transference of energy to the matter. The momentum lost is converted to energy extracted.

Paragraph: The Black Hole
The Black Hole is a 1979 American science fiction film directed by Gary Nelson and produced by Walt Disney Productions. The film stars Maximilian Schell, Robert Forster, Joseph Bottoms, Yvette Mimieux, Anthony Perkins, and Ernest Borgnine, while the voices of the main robot characters are provided by Roddy McDowall and Slim Pickens (both unbilled). The music for the film was composed by John Barry. It was the first film from Walt Disney Productions to receive a PG rating.

However, as is generally true of the CD reissues of these five volumes (though not nearly to the same extent), the tracks differ significantly on all five discs as compared to both the original Pebbles LPs and the later Pebbles CDs in the corresponding volumes; and the surf rock rarities on ""Pebbles, Volume 4"" have been eschewed entirely. Overall, there are 109 tracks in the box set (excluding the introduction and ending cuts) as compared to 101 songs on the individual CDs and 72 tracks in the ""Pebbles Box"". Although most of the recordings on ""the Trash Box"" were released at some point on one of the individual Pebbles albums, several of the songs have not appeared elsewhere in the Pebbles series. Inexplicably, one of these songs is the well-known hit ""I Fought the Law (but the Law Won)"" by the Bobby Fuller Four (on Disc Four) – which is also included in the ""Pebbles Box"" – in place of the much rarer ""Wine Wine Wine"" by Bobby Fuller that appears on ""Pebbles, Volume 2"".

"Paragraph: History of the American League
The History of the American League, officially known as the American League of Professional Baseball Clubs and often abbreviated AL, stretched back into the late-19th century. Prior to 2000, when the AL and NL were dissolved as separate entities and merged into the organization called Major League Baseball, the American League was one of the two leagues that made up major league baseball. Originally a minor league known as the Western League, the league later developed into a major league after the American Association disbanded. In its early history, the Western League struggled until 1894, when Ban Johnson became the president of the league. Johnson led the Western League into major league status and soon became the president of the newly renamed American League. The American League has one notable difference over the National League, and that is the designated hitter rule. Under the rule, a team may use a batter in their lineup who is not in the field defensively, compared to the old rule that made it mandatory for the pitcher to hit.

Paragraph: Designated hitter
In baseball, the designated hitter rule is the common name for Major League Baseball Rule 5.11, adopted by the American League in 1973. The rule allows teams to have one player, known as the designated hitter (abbreviated DH), to bat in place of the pitcher. Since 1973, most collegiate, amateur, and professional leagues have adopted the rule or some variant. MLB's National League and Nippon Professional Baseball's Central League are the most prominent professional leagues that do not use a designated hitter.

Paragraph: List of Chicago White Sox no-hitters
The Chicago White Sox are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Chicago. They play in the American League Central division. Pitchers for the White Sox have thrown eighteen no-hitters in franchise history. A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only “when a pitcher (or pitchers) allows no hits during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings. In a no-hit game, a batter may reach base via a walk, an error, a hit by pitch, a passed ball or wild pitch on strike three, or catcher’s interference.” No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. A no-hitter is rare enough that one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat. Three perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been pitched in White Sox history, which equals the New York Yankees for the most perfect games pitched by any MLB franchise. As defined by Major League Baseball, “in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.” These feats were achieved by Charlie Robertson in 1922, which was the first perfect game on the road in MLB history, Mark Buehrle in 2009, and Philip Humber in 2012.

Paragraph: Bill Pounds
Jeared Wells ""Bill"" Pounds (March 11, 1878 – July 7, 1936) was a pitcher in Major League Baseball. He appeared in just two major league games, one each for Cleveland and Brooklyn in 1903, but the only surviving images of him in a major league uniform show him with the New York Highlanders. Bill Pounds was born in Paterson, New Jersey, and had a long career as a minor league pitcher. His professional career began in 1899 when he pitched for both Binghamton and Paterson. After a year out of organized baseball, he played in 1901 and 1902 for two Ilion and Utica in the New York State League. After reportedly signing a contract to return to Utica for 1903, he was signed by Cleveland in the American League and was on their Opening Day roster. Pounds was brought in to pitch on May 2 in the fourth inning in Chicago when the White Stockings had opened up a big lead; he gave up seven runs (six earned) on eight hits in the 16-6 loss. On May 18 he was released by Cleveland and was signed shortly thereafter by the New York Highlanders. Pounds was in uniform with the team when the Highlanders visited Chicago for a series May 20–22. A photographer from the Chicago Daily News was taking pictures of the players on the teams visiting both the American League and National League ballparks, and during this visit Pounds had his image preserved for posterity. Before the end of the month, without having appeared in a game for New York, Pounds was sent back to Cleveland, apparently because he could not come to terms on a contract. On June 4 he was signed by Brooklyn of the National League, but he did not appear in a game until June 30. With Pittsburg ahead 12-0 after three innings, Pounds was sent in to pitch. He allowed five runs (four earned) in six innings on eight hits and two walks in the 17-8 loss, and gave up a long home run to Honus Wagner. On July 3, his contract was transferred to Baltimore of the Eastern League, along with that of Hughie Jennings and three other Dodgers. Pounds would never appear in another major league game; though his pitching record was unimpressive, he finished with a lifetime batting record of three hits in five at-bats. Late in the 1903 season, his contract was purchased by Denver, but it is unclear whether he actually played in Colorado. For the remainder of his minor-league career, from 1904 through 1911, he pitched for teams within a couple of hundred miles of his birth—four teams in the New York State League and two in the Tri-State League. In the off-seasons he would sometimes pitch for the Paterson Elks team, and he continued to pitch for them after his minor-league career had ended. According to The Sporting Life, “Pounds has speed and a rather good assortment of curves. He has not the best control in the world.” A few years after his career had ended, the Utica Observer described him in this way: “Bill Pounds was the champion sweater of the league. He perspired so much that…a miniature lake (formed) around the slab.” He died in 1936 in the city of his birth, aged 58. Early in the 21st century, the photographic archives of the Chicago Daily News were posted online. Although his teammates’ photographs were easily identified, the image of Pounds remained unidentified, or occasionally misidentified as Doc Adkins, for at least a decade.

Paragraph: Paixiao
The paixiao (traditional: 排簫; simplified: 排箫; pinyin: ""páixiāo""; also pái xiāo, pai-hsiao, pronounced ] ) is an ancient Chinese wind instrument, a form of Pan flute. A major difference between the Chinese Paixiao and the panpipes used in European and South American traditions, is that at the top of the Chinese instrument the pipe holes are each cut angled or with notches. This allows for bending the pitch in similar capacity to the dongxiao down a minor second. This allows Chinese paixiao to be fully chromatic without loss in timbre, even though the included pipes are tuned diatonically.

Paragraph: Defensive substitution
A defensive substitution in the game of baseball occurs when a currently non-playing player is placed into the field in place of another player, typically due either to injury or the appearance of a pinch hitter. In the American League, a pinch hitter is usually substituted for the position player in whose place he batted (although another common substitution is pinch-hitting a utility infielder for a second baseman and subsequently switching him for the shortstop in the field while moving the shortstop over to the now-vacant second base position). In the National League, which does not use the designated hitter rule, pinch hitters sometimes bat for pitchers. However, another common pitcher-substitution strategy in the NL is the double switch, in which a pitching change is coupled with a pinch-hitter who is also defensively substituted for a second player.

Paragraph: List of Houston Astros no-hitters
The Houston Astros (formerly known as the ""Houston Colt .45s"" from 1962–64) are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Houston, Texas. Formed in 1962, they play in the American League West division (formerly in the National League Central division until 2012). Pitchers for the Astros have thrown eleven no-hitters in franchise history. A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only “when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings”. No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. A no-hitter is rare enough that one team in Major League Baseball has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat. No perfect games, a special subcategory of no-hitter, have been thrown in Astros history. As defined by Major League Baseball, “in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.”

Paragraph: List of Major League Baseball batting champions
In baseball, batting average (AVG) is a measure of a batter's success rate in achieving a hit during an at bat. In Major League Baseball (MLB), it is calculated by dividing a player's hits by his at bats (AB). In MLB, a player in each league wins the ""batting title"" each season for having the highest batting average that year. The American League (AL) winner is known as the ""Rod Carew American League Batting Champion"", while the National League (NL) leader is designated the ""Tony Gwynn National League Batting Champion"". Under current rules, a player must have 3.1 plate appearances (PA) per team game (for a total of 502 over the current 162-game season) to qualify for the batting title. However, if a player's lead in AVG is sufficiently large that enough hitless at bats can be added to reach this requirement and the player still would have the highest batting average, he wins the title. Tony Gwynn, for example, had 159 hits in 451 ABs in 1996 (.353 average) but only 498 PAs. Gwynn's batting average would have dropped to .349 (159 hits in 455 ABs) with four hitless ABs added to reach the 502 PA requirement, but this would still have been higher than the next-highest eligible player (.344 average), so he was awarded the 1996 NL batting title.

Paragraph: List of Milwaukee Brewers no-hitters
The Milwaukee Brewers (formerly known as the ""Seattle Pilots"" in 1969) are a Major League Baseball franchise based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Formed in 1969, they play in the National League Central division (formerly in the American League Central Division until 1997). Juan Nieves threw the only no-hitter in franchise history on April 15, 1987. A no-hitter is officially recognized by Major League Baseball only ""when a pitcher (or pitchers) retires each batter on the opposing team during the entire course of a game, which consists of at least nine innings"". No-hitters of less than nine complete innings were previously recognized by the league as official; however, several rule alterations in 1991 changed the rule to its current form. A no-hitter is rare enough that a Major League Baseball team, the San Diego Padres, has never had a pitcher accomplish the feat. A perfect game, a special subcategory of no-hitter, has yet to be thrown in Brewers history. As defined by Major League Baseball, ""in a perfect game, no batter reaches any base during the course of the game.""

The 1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 57th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 15, 1986, at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, the home of the Houston Astros of the National League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3-2 and ended a streak where the NL won 13 of the last 14 games.

British composer Michael Tippett composed his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra between 1953 and 1955 on a commission from the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. The overall character of the work was influenced by the composer's hearing German pianist Walter Gieseking rehearse Ludwig van Beethoven's Fourth Piano Concerto in 1950. Its musical content, while influenced by this concerto, was also shaped largely by Tippett's opera ""The Midsummer Marriage"", which he had completed in 1952.

Paragraph: The Sound Pattern of English
The Sound Pattern of English (frequently referred to as SPE) is a 1968 work on phonology (a branch of linguistics) by Noam Chomsky and Morris Halle.

"Paragraph: Miracle at the New Meadowlands
The Miracle at the New Meadowlands, also called ""New Miracle at the New Meadowlands and ""Miracle at the Meadowlands II"" is the term used by sportscasters and Philadelphia Eagles fans to refer to an improbable come-from-behind win by the Philadelphia Eagles over rival team the New York Giants at New Meadowlands Stadium on December 19, 2010. The game was a crucial one in the context of the season, played between two divisional rivals in Week 15 of the 2010 NFL season. With just under eight minutes to play in the fourth quarter, the Eagles trailed the Giants by 21 points. They went on to score four unanswered touchdowns in the final seven minutes and 28 seconds of play, including a punt returned for a touchdown by DeSean Jackson as time expired. Jackson became the first player in NFL history to win a game by scoring on a punt return as time expired. The win allowed the Eagles to progress to the 2010 NFL playoffs, where they lost to eventual Super Bowl champion Green Bay.

Paragraph: Chicago Tigers

The Tigers were never formally members of the APFA. However, since the team played seven games against APFA teams in 1920, resulting in a 1–5–1 league record, they are generally included in the league standings.

Paragraph: 1986 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season
The 1986 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season began with the team trying to improve on an 2–14 season. This was one of the worst seasons in franchise history. There is some sentiment that the 1986 team was even worse than the winless team of 1976, and the 473 points conceded was not beaten by any NFL team until the 2001 Indianapolis Colts gave up 486. The Buccaneers selected Bo Jackson with the top pick in the draft, but were unable to convince him to join the team. Three weeks after the draft, Jackson signed a three-year baseball contract with the Kansas City Royals. Despite holding four of the first forty selections in the draft, and the presence of a great influx of fresh talent from defunct USFL teams, the Buccaneers were unable to find any impact players in either the draft or free agency. They entered the season with a roster nearly identical to the previous season's 2–14 team.

In 1945, because of financial difficulties and the increasing scarcity of major league-level players because of the war-time defense requirements at the height of World War II, the team was merged with the Boston Yanks and were known as the Yanks for that season. This old NFL franchise was not related to the earlier (second incarnation) American Football League II with a franchise that played as the Brooklyn Tigers for the first half of the 1936 season before moving to Rochester, New York and playing as the Rochester Tigers. Another NFL team that played in the Brooklyn borough was the Brooklyn Lions (which became the Brooklyn Horsemen after merging with a team from an earlier first incarnation AFL of the same name) in 1926. Later co-owner and partner Dan Topping (1912–1974), pulled the Tigers team out of the old NFL in 1946 and placed it in the newly established rival professional league – the All-America Football Conference, which shortly lasted until 1949 until several stronger teams from the AAFC merged with and entered a reorganized NFL in 1950. It lasted until 1970 with the NFL-AFL (third) merger following the establishment of the first ""Super Bowl"" inter-league national championship game three years before with the old NFL champions playing the victors of the latest rival fourth incarnation of the American Football League IV, formed in 1960 (now the American Football Conference (AFC).

He played three seasons for the Philadelphia Eagles (1940) and the Pittsburgh Steelers (1941–1942). He was the first receiver in NFL history to have over 100 yards receiving in each of his first two games, a feat which was not equaled until the 2008 NFL season by another Eagles wide receiver, DeSean Jackson. At the time of his death, Looney was the second oldest living former NFL player.

Paragraph: 2008–09 Boston Celtics season
The 2008–09 Boston Celtics season was the 63rd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA), starting out as the defending NBA champions. The Celtics started the season 27–2, which surpassed a mark set by the 1966–67 Philadelphia 76ers for the best two-loss start in NBA history. This run also included a 19-game winning streak, which improved a Celtics franchise record set in 1981–82. However, the Celtics lost seven out of the following nine games, and eventually finished with a 62–20 record.

Paragraph: 2011–12 Boston Celtics season
The 2011–12 Boston Celtics season was the 66th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Boston Celtics finished the regular season with a 39–27 won-loss record, which was the 4th best in the East, winning their 21st Atlantic Division title. Their longest winning and losing streaks were 5 games. The leading scorer was Paul Pierce, averaging 19.4 PPG. The leading rebounder was Kevin Garnett (8.2 RPG). Rajon Rondo led the team and the league in assists per-game with 11.7. The regular season was reduced from its usual 82 games to 66 due to the lockout. The Celtics made a relatively deep playoff run, challenging the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals. They ultimately lost in seven games. Following the season, Ray Allen left for the Heat, effectively ending the Big 3 era in Boston.

Paragraph: 1977–78 Boston Celtics season
The 1977–78 Boston Celtics season was the 32nd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was linked to the Buffalo Braves season. While the Braves were struggling on the court, their owner John Y. Brown brokered a deal to take over the legendary Celtics franchise. Celtics owner Irv Levin wanted to move the franchise to California, however, the NBA would not allow him to take the cornerstone franchise out of Boston.

Paragraph: 1946–47 Boston Celtics season
The 1946–47 Boston Celtics season was the first season of the Boston Celtics in the Basketball Association of America (BAA/NBA). Walter A. Brown was the man who was responsible for starting the franchise. On an early June day in 1946, Brown, who operated the Boston Garden arena and was part of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins, was the driving force behind the Basketball Association of America and the Celtics birth. After considering several team names, including Whirlwinds, Unicorns and Olympics, Brown opted for Celtics. He hoped to grab the attention of Boston's large Irish American population. John Davis ""Honey"" Russell was hired as the first Celtics coach, and the team soon began its inaugural season, losing its first game 59–53 to the Providence Steamrollers. Although the Celtics would eventually become the signature franchise of the NBA, the club had a lacklustre first season as they started with 0 wins and 5 losses. The Celtics won their first game of the season against the Toronto Huskies.

Paragraph: 2012–13 Boston Celtics season
The 2012–13 Boston Celtics season was the 67th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Their longest winning and losing streaks were 7 and 6 games respectively. The leading scorer was Paul Pierce, averaging 18.6 PPG. The leading rebounder was Kevin Garnett (7.8 RPG). Rajon Rondo led the team and the league in assists per-game with 11.1 despite only playing 38 games due to ACL injury. The Celtics only played 81 games as their April 16 game was cancelled in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and was not rescheduled because it would not have changed any part of the final Eastern Conference standings anyway. The Celtics would go on to lose in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since the 2004–05 season. This season would mark the end of the Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett era in Boston as they were traded to the Brooklyn Nets during the 2013 off-season.

Paragraph: 2007–08 Boston Celtics season
The 2007–2008 Boston Celtics season was the 62nd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Powered by the acquisitions of perennial All-Stars Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the offseason, the Celtics finished with a record of 66–16 and posted the best single-season turnaround in NBA history. They finished first in both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference, and achieved the league's best record. The 66 wins were also the third-most in franchise history, behind the 1972–73 Celtics’ 68 wins and the famous 1985–86 Celtics’ 67 wins including 40 at home. Kevin Garnett was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, while Danny Ainge, who executed ""the most dramatic NBA turnaround ever"", was named NBA Executive of the Year. The Celtics also sold out all 41 regular-season home games.

Paragraph: 1988–89 Boston Celtics season
The 1988–89 Boston Celtics season was the 43rd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). This was the first season for Jim Rodgers as head coach. Rodgers had been a Celtics assistant coach prior to this season. This year's Celtics team was severely hindered by the loss of star forward Larry Bird to a heel injury which required surgery. Bird played only six early-season games before being lost to injury. Initially, Bird was expected back in March, but it was delayed and ultimately became a season-ending injury. The results were dramatic as the Celtics, who had averaged over 60 wins per season thus far in the 1980s, fell to just 42 wins in this season. Coming into the season, the Celtics had been the Eastern Conference's #1 seed five years in a row. This season they were the #8 seed, clinching a playoff spot in the season's final game. This season included some bright spots, particularly the emergence of guard Reggie Lewis, who had been only a minimal bench contributor in his rookie season of 1987-88, but averaged nearly 20 points per game as a starter in 1988-89.

Paragraph: 2009–10 Boston Celtics season

The Celtics made a relatively deep playoff run, challenging the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals. They ultimately lost in seven games. Following the season, Ray Allen left for the Heat, effectively ending the Big 3 era in Boston.

Paragraph: 1977–78 Boston Celtics season
The 1977–78 Boston Celtics season was the 32nd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and was linked to the Buffalo Braves season. While the Braves were struggling on the court, their owner John Y. Brown brokered a deal to take over the legendary Celtics franchise. Celtics owner Irv Levin wanted to move the franchise to California, however, the NBA would not allow him to take the cornerstone franchise out of Boston.

Paragraph: 1946–47 Boston Celtics season
The 1946–47 Boston Celtics season was the first season of the Boston Celtics in the Basketball Association of America (BAA/NBA). Walter A. Brown was the man who was responsible for starting the franchise. On an early June day in 1946, Brown, who operated the Boston Garden arena and was part of the National Hockey League's Boston Bruins, was the driving force behind the Basketball Association of America and the Celtics birth. After considering several team names, including Whirlwinds, Unicorns and Olympics, Brown opted for Celtics. He hoped to grab the attention of Boston's large Irish American population. John Davis ""Honey"" Russell was hired as the first Celtics coach, and the team soon began its inaugural season, losing its first game 59–53 to the Providence Steamrollers. Although the Celtics would eventually become the signature franchise of the NBA, the club had a lacklustre first season as they started with 0 wins and 5 losses. The Celtics won their first game of the season against the Toronto Huskies.

Paragraph: 2012–13 Boston Celtics season
The 2012–13 Boston Celtics season was the 67th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Boston Celtics finished the regular season with a 41–40 won-loss record, which was the 3rd best in the Atlantic division, bringing an end to the 5-year run as Atlantic Champs and 7th best in the East. Their longest winning and losing streaks were 7 and 6 games respectively. The leading scorer was Paul Pierce, averaging 18.6 PPG. The leading rebounder was Kevin Garnett (7.8 RPG). Rajon Rondo led the team and the league in assists per-game with 11.1 despite only playing 38 games due to ACL injury. The Celtics only played 81 games as their April 16 game was cancelled in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and was not rescheduled because it would not have changed any part of the final Eastern Conference standings anyway. The Celtics would go on to lose in the first round of the playoffs to the New York Knicks in six games, marking the first time the Celtics were eliminated in the First Round of the playoffs since the 2004–05 season. 

Paragraph: 2007–08 Boston Celtics season
The 2007–2008 Boston Celtics season was the 62nd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Powered by the acquisitions of perennial All-Stars Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the offseason, the Celtics finished with a record of 66–16 and posted the best single-season turnaround in NBA history. They finished first in both the Atlantic Division and the Eastern Conference, and achieved the league's best record. The 66 wins were also the third-most in franchise history, behind the 1972–73 Celtics’ 68 wins and the famous 1985–86 Celtics’ 67 wins including 40 at home. Kevin Garnett was named NBA Defensive Player of the Year, while Danny Ainge, who executed ""the most dramatic NBA turnaround ever"", was named NBA Executive of the Year.

Paragraph: 1988–89 Boston Celtics season
The 1988–89 Boston Celtics season was the 43rd season of the Boston Celtics in the National Basketball Association (NBA). This was the first season for Jim Rodgers as head coach. Rodgers had been a Celtics assistant coach prior to this season. This year's Celtics team was severely hindered by the loss of star forward Larry Bird to a heel injury which required surgery. Bird played only six early-season games before being lost to injury. Initially, Bird was expected back in March, but it was delayed and ultimately became a season-ending injury. The results were dramatic as the Celtics, who had averaged over 60 wins per season thus far in the 1980s, fell to just 42 wins in this season. Coming into the season, the Celtics had been the Eastern Conference's #1 seed five years in a row. This season they were the #8 seed, clinching a playoff spot in the season's final game. This season included some bright spots, particularly the emergence of guard Reggie Lewis, who had been only a minimal bench contributor in his rookie season of 1987-88, but averaged nearly 20 points per game as a starter in 1988-89.

Paragraph: 2009–10 Boston Celtics season

Paragraph: Discofox
Discofox or disco fox is a social partner dance which evolved in Europe in the mid-1970s as a rediscovery of the dance hold in the improvisational disco dance scene dominated by solo dancing, approximately at the same time when the hustle emerged in the United States. Both dances were greatly influenced by ""Saturday Night Fever"" starring John Travolta.

Paragraph: Jam skating
Jam skating (or Jamskating) is a combination of dance, gymnastics, and skating, performed on roller skates. The origins of jam skating are disputed, but it is often traced to the Great Lakes region and Florida. The style has its roots in traditional roller disco, but has been greatly influenced by breakdancing, artistic skating, gymnastics, and modern dance. Successful jam skaters are well practiced in these different forms and must have the ability to translate these movements while on skates. Jam skating first became popular in the early 1990s and is still going strong throughout the nation. Competitions, such as Heartbreak Skating Competition (Carrollton, GA), Pajama Jam (Franklin, IN), Southern Slam (Anderson, SC), and The Championship (Cookeville, TN) are examples of existing competitions happening. Jam Skating, like breakdancing in its early evolution, was an almost underground movement fueled by teenagers and skaters in their early 20s. Events were created to allow Jam Skaters to meet, trade moves, and, most importantly, ""battle"". Battling and performing remain a very important aspect of Jam Skating. This element pushes the boundaries of what is possible to perform while on skates; moreover, it ignites evolution within the skate culture.

Paragraph: The Man in the Moone
The Man in the Moone is a book by the English divine and Church of England bishop Francis Godwin (1562–1633), describing a ""voyage of utopian discovery"". Long considered to be one of his early works, it is now generally thought to have been written in the late 1620s. It was first published posthumously in 1638 under the pseudonym of Domingo Gonsales. The work is notable for its role in what was called the ""new astronomy"", the branch of astronomy influenced especially by Nicolaus Copernicus. Although Copernicus is the only astronomer mentioned by name, the book also draws on the theories of Johannes Kepler and William Gilbert. Godwin's astronomical theories were greatly influenced by Galileo Galilei's ""Sidereus Nuncius"" (1610), but unlike Galileo, Godwin proposes that the dark spots on the Moon are seas, one of many parallels with Kepler's ""Somnium sive opus posthumum de astronomia lunari"" of 1634.

In Christchurch in 1906, of a small field of 10 players, only two Australians attended, and the tournament was won by a New Zealander (Tony Wilding). Lawn Tennis Association of Australasia was one of the twelve national associations of tennis which established the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) in a conference in Paris, France on 1 March 1913.

Alderman Elementary School in Wilmington and Alderman dorm at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Alderman was the key leader in higher education in Virginia during the Progressive Era as president of the University of Virginia, 1904-31. His goal was the transformation of the Southern university into a force for state service and intellectual leadership and educational utility. Alderman successfully professionalized and modernized Virginia's system of higher education. He promoted international standards of scholarship, and a statewide network of extension services. Joined by other college presidents, he promoted the Virginia Education Commission, created in 1910. Alderman's crusade encountered some resistance from traditionalists and never challenged the Jim Crow system of segregated schooling.

Paragraph: Henry C. Groseclose
Henry C. Groseclose was born on May 17, 1892. He lived in Ceres, Virginia for most of his life. Mr. Groseclose completed his junior college degree from Washington and Lee University in 1917. In his later years, he also received his bachelor’s degree, as well as his master’s degree, in agricultural education from Virginia Tech. While Mr. Groseclose was an agriculture teacher at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute, he, along with three other agriculture teachers, Walter Newman, Edmund Magill and Harry Sanders, decided to establish a club for the farm boys in the school. The organization was fired up in 1925. Groseclose named the organization the Future Farmers of Virginia, or FFV for short. The original meaning for the abbreviation FFV stood for the First Families of Virginia. The “first families” referred to the families of both George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. Referring to Washington and Jefferson, Groseclose once stated that, “The Future Farmers of America should follow the example of these great sons of early Virginia by using scientific knowledge, intelligence, and enthusiasm to the end that agriculture may again be known as the profession of the real aristocrat.” Groseclose wrote the by-laws, as well as the constitution that the FFV would be based on. In 1926, he also wrote, and brought into play, the formal ceremony that would take place as an organizational pattern to structure each meeting. Two years later, in 1928, the FFV became a nationwide organization. This developed the organization that is known today as the Future Farmers of America, or The National FFA Organization, or just FFA for short. The by-laws drawn up by Henry Groseclose became the foundation of the newly national organization. Also, the formal ceremony that Groseclose developed was taken on by the FFA as a national ritual that is still used today. Groseclose was a seventh degree Grange member, and he was also involved with the Masons, so it was no surprise when he developed levels of memberships for the FFV, which transferred through to the FFA, that were similar to the three leveled membership structure that the Masons uses. These three levels included the Greenhand, the Virginia Farmer and the Virginia Planter. While the official emblem of the National FFA Organization was being drawn, Groseclose’s original emblem, which he hand drew himself, was highly considered and ended up playing a part in the emblem that is still the emblem of the National FFA Organization today. The part of the emblem that was from Mr. Groseclose’s original drawing included a background setting of a half plowed wheat field with an owl perched upon a spade of wheat in front of the field. Henry Groseclose served as the Executive Secretary of the National FFA Organization for two years between 1928 and 1930. During his office of Executive Secretary, he announced at the national convention of 1930 that he had written, and would be releasing, an official FFA manual, which outlined the organization, procedures and structures of the National FFA Organization. Mr. Groseclose also served as the Treasurer of the National FFA Organization for 11 years, between 1930 and 1941. In September 1925, Henry Groseclose set his expectations for the members of the FFV, and the purpose of the establishment of the Future Farmers of Virginia was by saying, ""In my opinion the farm boys of Virginia who are enrolled in vocational agriculture are equal to any other group of boys in the state. But somehow the boys themselves seem to have a feeling of inferiority. Especially is this true when the farm boy goes to the city and has to compete with his city cousin. This condition should not exist. I believe that a strong organization of our boys in agriculture would help them to overcome this handicap. Let's form an organization that will give them a greater opportunity for self-expression and for the development of leadership. In this way they will develop confidence in their own ability and pride in the fact that they are farm boys."" Mr. Henry C. Groseclose died on June 4 of 1950. In 2002, the Department of Historic Resources established a marker in Mr. Groseclose’s honor. It is Marker number KC-5 and it is displayed in Bland County of Ceres, Virginia.

They are currently known as the Los Angeles Clippers. In an NBA expansion draft, new NBA teams are allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league. Not all players on a given team are available during an expansion draft, since each team can protect a certain number of players from being selected. In this draft, each of the fourteen other NBA teams had protected seven players from their roster. After each round, where each of the expansion teams had selected one player each, the existing teams added another player to their protected list.

Paragraph: Jackie Walker (American football, born 1962)
Jackie Walker (born November 3, 1962) is a former an American football linebacker who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He was the 28th player selected in the 1986 NFL Draft, the first player drafted in the second round of a year in which there were only 27 first-round picks. His selection was controversial, as he did not score particularly well in the pre-draft combines, and there were more-heralded linebackers still on the board. Walker attended Carroll High School in Monroe, Louisiana. He was a latecomer to organized sports, not playing football until high school coaches and his older brother convinced him to join the team in his senior year of high school. A quick and aggressive player, he was a starter all four years at Jackson State University, where he also played power forward for the basketball team. In his senior year, he led the team with 131 tackles, was named to two All-American teams, and was named Southwestern Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. While the Buccaneers staff were impressed with his raw talent and saw him as a potential Ted Hendricks-type player, the fans were critical of the selection of a player with so little training and experience. Walker started only nine games for the Buccaneers, all in 1987. Although popular with teammates and a standout on special teams, he never worked his way into the regular lineup. Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins at one point toyed with the idea of taking advantage of his athleticism by converting him to tight end, but dropped the idea due to lack of interest from Walker. When Plan B free agency began in 1989, Walker was one of the players allowed to leave. He was signed by the New York Jets in 1989 after being left unprotected by the Buccaneers, but was cut from the Jets in training camp. He later played for the Cincinnati Rockers, Miami Hooters, and Orlando Predators of the Arena ","Paragraph: 2001–02 Atlanta Hawks season

Before the draft, 26 college underclassmen were declared eligible for selection under the ""hardship"" rule. 13 of them withdrew before the draft, leaving only 13 early entry candidates eligible for selection. These players had applied and gave evidence of financial hardship to the league, which granted them the right to start earning their living by starting their professional careers earlier. The draft consisted of 10 rounds comprising the selection of 173 players. On August 8, 1976, the league also hosted a Dispersal draft for ABA players from the Kentucky Colonels and Spirits of St. Louis, who were not included in the ABA–NBA merger.

Paragraph: 1970 NBA Expansion Draft
The 1970 NBA Expansion Draft was the fifth expansion draft of the National Basketball Association (NBA). The draft was held on May 11, 1970, so that the newly founded Buffalo Braves, Cleveland Cavaliers and Portland Trail Blazers could acquire players for the upcoming 1970–71 season. Buffalo, Cleveland and Portland had been awarded the expansion teams on February 6, 1970. The Braves later underwent several name changes and relocations before moving to Los Angeles. They are currently known as the Los Angeles Clippers. In an NBA expansion draft, new NBA teams are allowed to acquire players from the previously established teams in the league. Not all players on a given team are available during an expansion draft, since each team can protect a certain number of players from being selected. In this draft, each of the fourteen other NBA teams had protected seven players from their roster. After each round, where each of the expansion teams had selected one player each, the existing teams added another player to their protected list. In the first round, the Braves had the first pick, while the Blazers and the Cavaliers had the second and the third pick respectively. In the subsequent rounds, the Braves and the Cavaliers exchanged their order of selection, while the Blazers had the second pick throughout the draft. The draft continued until all three teams had selected eleven unprotected players each, while the existing teams had lost two or three players each.

Paragraph: Jackie Walker (American football, born 1962)
Jackie Walker (born November 3, 1962) is a former an American football linebacker who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He was the 28th player selected in the 1986 NFL Draft, the first player drafted in the second round of a year in which there were only 27 first-round picks. His selection was controversial, as he did not score particularly well in the pre-draft combines, and there were more-heralded linebackers still on the board. Walker attended Carroll High School in Monroe, Louisiana. He was a latecomer to organized sports, not playing football until high school coaches and his older brother convinced him to join the team in his senior year of high school. A quick and aggressive player, he was a starter all four years at Jackson State University, where he also played power forward for the basketball team. In his senior year, he led the team with 131 tackles, was named to two All-American teams, and was named Southwestern Athletic Conference Defensive Player of the Year. While the Buccaneers staff were impressed with his raw talent and saw him as a potential Ted Hendricks-type player, the fans were critical of the selection of a player with so little training and experience. Walker started only nine games for the Buccaneers, all in 1987. Although popular with teammates and a standout on special teams, he never worked his way into the regular lineup. Buccaneers coach Ray Perkins at one point toyed with the idea of taking advantage of his athleticism by converting him to tight end, but dropped the idea due to lack of interest from Walker. When Plan B free agency began in 1989, Walker was one of the players allowed to leave. He was signed by the New York Jets in 1989 after being left unprotected by the Buccaneers, but was cut from the Jets in training camp. He later played for the Cincinnati Rockers, Miami Hooters, and Orlando Predators of the Arena ","Which player selected out of the University of Florida with the third pick by the Hawks was born in June 3, 1986?",Alfred Joel Horford Reynoso

"Paragraph: Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel
Eastern Enterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that the Coal Industry Retiree Health Benefit Act (Coal Act) constituted an unconstitutional regulatory taking of property which required the Act to be invalidated. The import of this decision is that it was made in the context of a purely economic regulation. The plurality examines the statute and its resultant harm as an ad hoc factual inquiry based on factors delineated in Penn Central such as the economic impact of the regulation, its interference with reasonable investment backed expectations, and the character of the governmental action. (""Penn Central Transportation Co. v. New York City""), The decision thereby moved beyond the traditional notions of equal protection which had been applied to economic regulation since the time of (""Lochner v. New York""), requiring extreme deference to Congress, and applied a regulatory takings analysis to the problem resulting in a much less deferential result. While the plurality recognizes that this is not a traditional takings case where the government appropriates private property for public use, they also state this is the type of case where the ""Armstrong Principle"" of preventing the government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole. (""Armstrong v. United States"", 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960)) However, while the plurality seems to invalidate this particular law on takings grounds, the concurrences and the dissents warn of such an analysis as this should actually be examined under substantive due process or ex post facto theories.

Paragraph: Stephen Halbrook
Stephen P. Halbrook is a Senior Fellow at the Independent Institute and an author and lawyer known for his litigation on behalf of the National Rifle Association. He has written extensively about the original meanings of the Second Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment (the latter as applied to Second Amendment rights). He has argued and won three cases before the US Supreme Court: ""Printz v. United States"", ""United States v. Thompson-Center Arms Company"", and ""Castillo v. United States"". He has also written briefs in many other cases, including the Supreme Court cases ""Small v. United States"" (pertaining to the Gun Control Act of 1968) and ""McDonald v. Chicago"". In ""District of Columbia v. Heller"", he wrote a brief on behalf of the majority of both houses of Congress. More broadly, his decades of research on the Second Amendment contributed to the intellectual foundation of the ""Heller"" decision. He has written many books and articles on the topic of gun control, some of which have been cited in Supreme Court opinions (""Heller"", ""McDonald"", ""Printz v. United States""). He has testified before congress on multiple occasions. Halbrook’s most important scholarly contribution, however, was the book ""That Every Man Be Armed"", originally published in 1986. The book was the most thorough analysis of the legal history and original intent of the Second Amendment.

Paragraph: Lochner era
The ""Lochner"" era is a period in American legal history from 1897 to 1937 in which the Supreme Court of the United States is said to have made it a common practice ""to strike down economic regulations adopted by a State based on the Court’s own notions of the most appropriate means for the State to implement its considered policies,"" by using its interpretation of substantive due process to strike down laws held to be infringing on economic liberty or private contract rights. The era takes its name from a 1905 case, ""Lochner v. New York"". The beginning of the era is usually marked earlier, with the Court's decision in ""Allgeyer v. Louisiana"" (1897), and its end marked forty years later in the case of ""West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish"" (1937), which overturned an earlier ""Lochner""-era decision.

Paragraph: Evans v. Jordan
Evans v. Jordan, 13 U.S. 199 (1815) , was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that someone who had copied a patented invention after the patent had expired, and before the patent was restored by a private bill, would be liable for damages for patent infringement for any use continuing after the patent was restored. It was the second published Supreme Court decision on patent law, and the first of four Supreme Court cases dealing with the Oliver Evans flour mill patent. Like other Supreme Court patent cases prior to ""Evans v. Eaton"", however, this case did not deal with substantive patent law, but only with issues of statutory construction and infringement liability.

Paragraph: Spaziano v. Florida
Spaziano v. Florida, was two United States Supreme Court cases dealing with the imposition of the death penalty. In the first case, 454 U.S. 1037 (1981), the Supreme Court, with two dissents, refused Spaziano's petition for certiorari. However, the Florida Supreme Court would reverse Spaziano's death sentence based on the judge's receipt of a confidential report which was not received by either party. On remand, the judge reimposed the death penalty and the Florida Supreme Court upheld the sentence. In the second case, 468 U.S. 447 (1984) the Court heard Spaziano's appeal of his death sentence.

Paragraph: List of United States state supreme court cases
Every year, each of the 50 United States state supreme courts decides hundreds of cases. Of those cases dealing with state law, a few significantly shape or re-shape the law of their state or are so influential that they later become models for decisions of other states or the federal government, or are noted for being rejected by other jurisdictions. The same is true of those cases involving a federal question, except that these may be appealed to the United States Supreme Court. This list contains notable final decisions of these courts – those that were not subject to appeal, or from which no appeal was taken, or from which an appeal was taken but certiorari was denied. Appealed decisions that are notable primarily because of later actions of the U.S. Supreme Court covered in the listings of U.S. Supreme Court cases. The decisions are listed in chronological order.

Paragraph: Cooley v. Board of Wardens
Cooley v. Board of Wardens, 53 U.S. 299 (1852), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a Pennsylvania law requiring all ships entering or leaving Philadelphia to hire a local pilot did not violate the Commerce Clause of the Constitution. Those who did not comply with the law had been required to pay a fee. ""It is the opinion of a majority of the court that the mere grant to Congress of the power to regulate commerce, did not deprive the States of power to regulate pilots, and that although Congress had legislated on this subject, its legislation manifests an intention, with a single exception, not to regulate this subject, but to leave its regulation to the several states,"" wrote Justice Curtis for the majority.

Paragraph: Commercial speech
Commercial speech is a U.S. legal term relating to speech done on behalf of a company or individual for the intent of making a profit. It is economic in nature and usually has the intent of convincing the audience to partake in a particular action, often purchasing a specific product. Generally, the United States Supreme Court defines commercial speech as speech that ""proposes a commercial transaction."" The Court developed a three factor inquiry in determining whether speech is commercial in the 1983 case ""Bolger v. Youngs Drug Products"" namely, (1) is the material meant to be an advertisement, (2) does the material reference a particular product, and (3) is there is an economic motivation for disseminating the material? If all of these attributes are present, then it is commercial speech. These factors have yet to be utilized in other Supreme Court cases dealing with commercial speech.

Paragraph: Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC
Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission, 512 U.S. 622 (1994), is the first of two United States Supreme Court cases dealing with the must carry rules imposed on cable television companies. ""Turner Broadcasting v. Federal Communications Commission (II)"", 520 U.S. 180 (1997) was the second. ""Turner I"" established that cable television companies were indeed First Amendment speakers but didn't decide whether the federal regulation of their speech infringed upon their speech rights. In ""Turner II"" the court decided that the must carry provisions were constitutional. Under the ""Miami Herald v. Tornillo"" case, it was unconstitutional to force a newspaper to run a story the editors would not have included absent a government statute because it was compelled speech which could not pass the strict scrutiny of a compelling state interest being achieved with the least restrictive means necessary to achieve the state interest. However, under the rule of ""Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC"" the High Court held that a federal agency could regulate broadcast stations (TV and Radio) with far greater discretion. In order for federal agency regulation of broadcast media to pass constitutional muster, it need only serve an important state interest and need not narrowly tailor its regulation to the least restrictive means.

Paragraph: Benjamin A. Rogge
Benjamin A. Rogge (June 18, 1920 – November 17, 1980) was an American economist, college administrator, and libertarian writer, speaker and foundation advisor. Rogge received an A.B. degree from Hastings College and an M.A. from the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Rogge received his PhD in economics from Northwestern. At Wabash College, Rogge taught in the summer Institute for Professional Development, in addition to his usual teaching in economics. Rogge co-authored an economics principles textbook with John Van Sickle. One strength of the text is the account that it gives of Joseph Schumpeter's process of creative destruction. Rogge helped organize a series of lectures by Milton Friedman at Wabash that were eventually developed into Friedman's ""Capitalism and Freedom"" book. Much later, Rogge participated in a brainstorming session for Friedman's Free to Choose television series. Liberty Fund was founded with money from Pierre Goodrich, who sought advice from Rogge during the Fund's early years. Rogge served for many years as a Liberty Fund trustee. Thomas Sowell gives Rogge credit for encouraging him to write a book on economics and race. Rogge also was a frequent presenter at the seminars of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). FEE's founder, Leonard Read, thought of Rogge as Read's eventual successor, an outcome prevented by Read outliving Rogge. An extended (but somewhat grainy) video clip of a Rogge FEE lecture on ""Competition and Monopoly"" on YouTube illustrates the dry wit that made him a popular speaker. Rogge attended 13 meetings of the influential international Mont Pelerin Society. Rogge helped produce, and narrated, a documentary on Adam Smith that was funded by Liberty Fund. Rogge wrote the introduction to a collection of quotations from Adam Smith. A collection of Rogge's speeches, often on topics in economics or education, was published under the title ""Can Capitalism Survive?"" Wabash College, where he taught for many years, established a speaker series in his honor. Rogge's archives are mainly housed at the Hoover Institute on the campus of Stanford University. A posthumous collection of Rogge's speeches and essays has appeared under the title ""A Maverick's Defense of Freedom"".

Paragraph: Benjamin A. Rogge
Benjamin A. Rogge (June 18, 1920 – November 17, 1980) was an American economist, college administrator, and libertarian writer, speaker and foundation advisor. Rogge received an A.B. degree from Hastings College and an M.A. from the University of Nebraska Lincoln. Rogge received his PhD in economics from Northwestern. At Wabash College, Rogge taught in the summer Institute for Professional Development, in addition to his usual teaching in economics. Rogge co-authored an economics principles textbook with John Van Sickle. One strength of the text is the account that it gives of Joseph Schumpeter's process of creative destruction. Rogge helped organize a series of lectures by Milton Friedman at Wabash that were eventually developed into Friedman's ""Capitalism and Freedom"" book. Much later, Rogge participated in a brainstorming session for Friedman's Free to Choose television series. Liberty Fund was founded with money from Pierre Goodrich, who sought advice from Rogge during the Fund's early years. Rogge served for many years as a Liberty Fund trustee. Thomas Sowell gives Rogge credit for encouraging him to write a book on economics and race. Rogge also was a frequent presenter at the seminars of the Foundation for Economic Education (FEE). FEE's founder, Leonard Read, thought of Rogge as Read's eventual successor, an outcome prevented by Read outliving Rogge. An extended (but somewhat grainy) video clip of a Rogge FEE lecture on ""Competition and Monopoly"" on YouTube illustrates the dry wit that made him a popular speaker. Rogge attended 13 meetings of the influential international Mont Pelerin Society. Rogge helped produce, and narrated, a documentary on Adam Smith that was funded by Liberty Fund. Rogge wrote the introduction to a collection of quotations from Adam Smith. A collection of Rogge's speeches, often on topics in economics or education, was published under the title ""Can Capitalism Survive?"" Wabash College, where he taught for many years, established a speaker series in his honor. Rogge's archives are mainly housed at the Hoover Institute on the campus of Stanford University. A posthumous collection of Rogge's speeches and essays has appeared under the title ""A Maverick's Defense of Freedom"".

But, notwithstanding the introduction of Ministerial Government, the resulting Legislative Council is still referred to as the 6th Legislative Council in deference to the five prior Councils elected under the 1950 Constitution.

Paragraph: Comhairle na dTeachtaí
Comhairle na dTeachtaí (; ""Council of the Delegates"") was an Irish republican parliament established by opponents of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty and the resulting Irish Free State, and viewed by republican legitimatists as a successor to the Second Dáil. Members were abstentionist from the Third Dáil established by the pro-Treaty faction. Just as the First Dáil established a parallel Irish Republic in opposition to the British Dublin Castle administration, so Comhairle na dTeachtaí attempted to establish a legitimatist government in opposition to the Provisional Government and Government of the Irish Free State established by the Third Dáil. This legitimatist government, called the Council of State, had Éamon de Valera as President. In 1926 de Valera resigned as President, left the Sinn Féin party and founded Fianna Fáil, which in 1927 entered the Fourth Dáil. Comhairle na dTeachtaí, never more than a symbolic body, was thereby rendered defunct. In 1930 Cumann na nGaedheal TDs alleged in the Dáil that de Valera had addressed Comhairle na dTeachtaí in December 1926, after the foundation of Fianna Fáil; this was to cast aspersions on de Valera's commitment to the Constitution of the I","In what year did the Irish Politician who led the Introduction of the Constitution of Ireland resign as President of the legitimatist government, the Council of State?",1926

Paragraph: Latvian name
Latvian names, like in most European cultures, consist of two main elements: the given name (""vārds"") followed by family name (""uzvārds"").

Paragraph: Middle name
In several cultures, people's names usually include one or more names in addition to the portion that is usually considered adequate to identify them. In a number of cultures where a given name is expected to precede the surname, such a name is likely to be placed after the given name and before the surname, and thus called a middle name. In English-speaking American culture, that term is often applied (arguably mistakenly) to names, occupying that position, even if the bearer would insist that that name is being mistakenly called a ""middle name"", and is actually (to mention several types of atypical cases):

Paragraph: The Daily Howler
The Daily Howler is an American political blog written by Bob Somerby. It was perhaps the first major political blog, started in 1998. The style is by turns earnest and sarcastic. Somerby criticizes what he considers the media's frequently biased or lazy coverage. In his view, the media frequently latch on to a generally agreed ""script"" with little regard for facts that contradict the script. For instance, in the runup to the U.S. 2000 election it was frequently said or assumed that Al Gore was untruthful, but Somerby shows that much of what supposedly underlay that script was in fact untrue, misrepresented or greatly exaggerated. He also argues that the media frequently ignore substantive issues and concentrate on trivial ones instead (in the 2000 presidential election, for example, professing bewilderment in response to the candidates' budget proposals while writing repeatedly and at length about irrelevant issues such as Gore's choice of clothes, or in 2006 writing articles about Barack Obama's middle name.)

"Paragraph: Pyramid Valley
Pyramid Valley is a limestone rock formation near Waikari in the North Canterbury region of New Zealand. It lies 80 km north-west of Christchurch. On the foot of the valley is a swamp which became notable in 1939 as New Zealand's largest paleontological site for moa fossils. In 1938 the landowners Joseph and Rob Hodgen found three large bones of Dinornis giganteus while they buried a dead horse in the swamp. They opened this area for excavations and in the early 1940s fossil hunters like Robert Falla, Roger Duff, Robert Cushman Murphy, Jim Eyles, Ron Scarlett and many others began their research work at this site and unearthed the remains of long extinct birds including more than 183 complete moa skeletons and tens of thousands of fossil bone fragments from about 46 species of Modern birds.

Paragraph: The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)
The Reform movement was rudimentary at the time, the result of loose coalitions that formed around contentious issues. Support was gained in Parliament through petitions meant to sway MPs.

The British Political Unions had successfully petitioned for the Great Reform Act of 1832 that eliminated much political corruption in the English Parliamentary system. Those who adopted these new forms of public mobilization for democratic reform in Upper Canada were inspired by the more radical Owenite Socialists who led the British Chartist and Mechanics Institute movements.

Paragraph: Land Arts of the American West
Land Arts of the American West is a studio-based field program that seeks to construct an expanded definition of land art through direct experience connecting the full range of human interventions in the landscape—from pre-contact indigenous to contemporary practice. Land art includes everything from constructing a road, to taking a walk, building a monument, and leaving a mark in the sand. The program seeks to expand upon connections between typically separate fields. Each fall we spend two months camping while traveling 7,000 miles to engage sites that range from the CLUI complex at Wendover, Utah to the pottery culture at Mata Ortiz, Mexico, from earth works like Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty to archeological sites like Chaco Canyon. We learn from the fact that Donald Judd surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and Navajo rugs; that Chaco Canyon and Roden Crater function as celestial instruments; and that the Very Large Array is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land. We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art. The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection.

Paragraph: Land Arts of the American West
Land Arts of the American West is a studio-based field program that seeks to construct an expanded definition of land art through direct experience connecting the full range of human interventions in the landscape—from pre-contact indigenous to contemporary practice. Land art includes everything from constructing a road, to taking a walk, building a monument, and leaving a mark in the sand. The program seeks to expand upon connections between typically separate fields. Each fall we spend two months camping while traveling 7,000 miles to engage sites that range from the CLUI complex at Wendover, Utah to the pottery culture at Mata Ortiz, Mexico, from earth works like Robert Smithson's Spiral Jetty to archeological sites like Chaco Canyon. We learn from the fact that Donald Judd surrounded himself with both contemporary sculpture and Navajo rugs; that Chaco Canyon and Roden Crater function as celestial instruments; and that the Very Large Array is a scientific research center with a powerful aesthetic presence on the land. We spend the semester living and working in the landscape with guest scholars that expand the range of our definition in disciplines including archeology, art history, architecture, ceramics, criticism, writing, design, and studio art. The immersive nature of how we experience the landscape triggers an amalgamated body of inquiry where students have the opportunity of time and space to develop authority in their work through direct action and reflection. Land Arts hinges on the primacy of first person experience and the realization that human-land relationships are ",What team was formed in 1996 that starred players like Robert Parish?,50 Greatest Players in National Basketball Association History
"Paragraph: 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season
The 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season was the 41st season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The season was to be a promising one, filled with All-Star talent at several positions. It was believed over the offseason, the Suns would be able to better incorporate Shaquille O'Neal, who necessitated changes to both the offense and defense after being obtained in a trade one season ago. It was also the first season head coach Terry Porter had been able to use the summer to implement his defensive approach for a team which had in seasons past scored a large number of their points off fast breaks and early in the shot clock. Sensing a need for change, team management traded for scorer Jason Richardson in December, but this did not appear to immediately reinvigorate an offense that had recently led the league in points per game. However, after Phoenix went 28–23 to start the season, Suns assistant Alvin Gentry was named to replace Porter as head coach. Less than one week after the All-Star Game, Amar'e Stoudemire sustained a season-ending eye injury while the improvement of the team never fully came. The Suns finished 46–36, second in the Pacific division but out the playoffs for the first time since Steve Nash rejoined the Suns in the 2004–05 season.

The Celtics only played 81 games as their April 16 game was cancelled in the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing and was not rescheduled because it would not have changed any part of the final Eastern Conference standings anyway. The Celtics would go on to lose in the first round of the playoffs for the first time since the 2004–05 season.

"Paragraph: Hurricane Norbert (2008)
Hurricane Norbert is tied with Hurricane Jimena as the strongest tropical cyclone strike the west coast of Baja California Sur in recorded history. The fifteenth named storm, seventh hurricane, and second major hurricane of the 2008 hurricane season, Norbert originated as a tropical depression from a tropical wave south of Acapulco on October 3. Strong wind shear initially prevented much development, but the cyclone encountered a more favorable environment as it moved westward. On October 5, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Norbert, and the system intensified further to attain hurricane intensity by October 6. After undergoing a period of rapid deepening, Norbert reached its peak intensity as a Category 4 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, with maximum sustained winds of 135 mph (215 km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg). As the cyclone rounded the western periphery of a subtropical ridge over Mexico, it began an eyewall replacement cycle which led to steady weakening. Completing this cycle and briefly reintensifying into a major hurricane, a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, Norbert moved ashore Baja California Sur as a Category 2 hurricane late on October 11. After a second landfall at a weaker intensity the following day, the system quickly weakened over land and dissipated that afternoon.

Paragraph: Hurricane Ophelia (2011)
Hurricane Ophelia was the most intense hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic hurricane season. The seventeenth tropical cyclone, sixteenth tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and third major hurricane, Ophelia originated in a tropical wave in the central Atlantic, forming approximately midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles on September 17. Tracking generally west-northwestward, Ophelia was upgraded to a tropical storm on September 21, and reached an initial peak of 65 mph (100 km/h) on September 22. As the storm entered a region of higher wind shear it began to weaken, and was subsequently downgraded to a remnant low on September 25. The following day, however, the remnants of the system began to reorganize as wind shear lessened, and on September 27, the National Hurricane Center once again began advisories on the system. Moving northward, Ophelia regained tropical storm status early on September 28, and rapidly deepened to attain its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) several days later. The system weakened as it entered cooler sea surface temperatures and began a gradual transition to an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed by October 3.

Paragraph: Timeline of the 2004 Pacific hurricane season
The 2004 Pacific hurricane season had 17 tropical cyclones, of which 12 became named storms, 6 became hurricanes, and 3 became major hurricanes (Category 3 or higher). This timeline documents all the storm formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipation. It also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned on, have been included. The season officially began on May 15, 2004 in the eastern Pacific proper (June 1, 2004 in the central Pacific) and lasted until November 30 that same year. Areas east of 140°W are under the purview of the National Hurricane Center (NHC); the area between the International Date Line and 140°W, or the central Pacific, is under the purview of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC).

Paragraph: Hurricane Faith
Hurricane Faith reached the northernmost latitude and had the longest track of any Atlantic tropical cyclone. The sixth named storm and fifth hurricane of the 1966 Atlantic hurricane season, Faith developed from an area of disturbed weather between Cape Verde and the west coast of Africa on August 21. Tracking westward, the depression gradually intensified and became Tropical Storm Faith on the following day. Moving westward across the Atlantic Ocean, it continued to slowly strengthen, reaching hurricane status early on August 23. About 42 hours later, Faith reached an initial peak with winds of 105 mph (165 km/h), before weakening slightly on August 26. Located near the Lesser Antilles, the outer bands of Faith produced gale force winds in the region, especially Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Antigua. Minor coastal damage occurred as far south as Trinidad and Tobago.

Paragraph: Timeline of the 1988 Atlantic hurricane season
The 1988 Atlantic hurricane season was an active season during which twelve tropical cyclones formed. The season officially began on June 1, 1988 and ended November 30, 1988, the dates which conventionally limit the period of each year when tropical cyclones tend to form in the Atlantic. This timeline documents tropical cyclone formations, strengthening, weakening, landfalls, extratropical transitions, as well as dissipations during the season. The timeline also includes information which was not operationally released, meaning that information from post-storm reviews by the National Hurricane Center, such as information on a storm that was not operationally warned upon. This season produced 19 tropical depressions, of which 12 became named storms; 5 attained hurricane status, of which 3 became a major hurricane, a storm that ranks as a Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The most notable storm in 1988 was Hurricane Gilbert, which was at the time the most intense hurricane in the Atlantic on record. Hurricane Gilbert caused about $5 billion in damage and 300 fatalities. The other notable storm was Hurricane Joan, which struck Nicaragua as a category 4 hurricane, and caused about $2 billion in damage and about 200 fatalities. Joan crossed into the Pacific and was renamed Miriam. Both Gilbert and Joan were retired by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 1989 and were replaced by Gordon and Joyce in 1994.

Paragraph: Hurricane! (Nova)
Hurricane! (episode: 1616 (308)) is a ""Nova"" episode that aired on November 7, 1989 on PBS. The episode describes the fury of a hurricane and the history of hurricane forecasting. The episode features footage of Hurricane Camille of 1969 and Hurricane Gilbert of 1988 and behind the scenes footage at the National Hurricane Center as forecasters tracked Hurricane Gilbert from its formation to its landfall in northern Mexico. Meteorologists, Hugh Willoughby, Bob Sheets (then director of the National Hurricane Center) and Jeff Masters were shown in the episode. The episode was released on VHS home video under the same episode title and distributed by WGBH Boston video. In 2004, the ""Nova"" episode was released on DVD and featured a different cover picture and title style. In 1997, UAV Corp. also distributed the ""Nova"" episode under the title Deadly Hurricanes which contains additional footage of Hurricane Andrew and Hurricane Iniki of 1992. The UAV version of the episode has since been discontinued.

Paragraph: 1966 Atlantic hurricane season
The 1966 Atlantic hurricane season featured the tropical cyclone with the longest track in the Atlantic basin – Hurricane Faith. Also during the year, the Miami, Florida Weather Office was re-designated the National Hurricane Center. The season officially began on June 1, and lasted until November 30. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin. It was a near average season in terms of tropical storms, with a total of 11 named storms. The first system, Hurricane Alma, developed over eastern Nicaragua on June 4. Alma brought severe flooding to Honduras and later to Cuba, after crossing the western Caribbean Sea. The storm also brought relatively minor impact to the Southeastern United States. Alma caused 91 deaths and about $210.1 million (1966 USD) in damage.

Paragraph: Hurricane Nora (2003)
Hurricane Nora was the final of five tropical cyclones to make landfall in the 2003 Pacific hurricane season. The fourteenth named storm and fifth hurricane of the season, Nora developed on October 1 from a tropical wave. It slowly intensified as it moved northwestward, intensifying into a hurricane on October 4. That day, Nora rapidly intensified to its peak of 100 mph (160 km/h), but the larger Hurricane Olaf to its east prevented further strengthening. An approaching trough turned the rapidly weakening system to the east toward Mexico. By October 7, it was downgraded to a tropical depression. Although it no longer met the criteria for being a tropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center continued issuing advisories due to the cyclone's proximity with land. Nora unexpectedly redeveloped an area of thunderstorms and moved ashore near Mazatlán, Sinaloa on October 9 before dissipating. The depression dropped locally heavy rainfall in western Mexico, but there were no reports of damage. Later, the remnants combined with Olaf and an upper-level low to produce flooding and a tornado in central Texas.

Paragraph: Hurricane Jova (2011)
Hurricane Jova was a strong Pacific hurricane that made landfall over Jalisco, Mexico. The tenth tropical depression and named storm, ninth hurricane, and fifth major hurricane of the 2011 Pacific hurricane season, Jova developed from an area of showers and thunderstorms that became better organized in early October. Moving towards the west-northwest, the area became better organized, and late on October 5, the National Hurricane Center began issuing advisories on Tropical Depression Ten-E. Steadily organizing, the storm was upgraded to Tropical Storm Jova later the following day, and by October 8, the storm had been classified as a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale. The storm attained Category 2 hurricane status late on October 9, and after a round of rapid intensification early on October 10, Jova had become a major hurricane.

Paragraph: 1991 Perfect Storm
The 1991 Perfect Storm, also known as The No-Name Storm (especially in the years immediately after it took place) and the Halloween Gale, was a nor'easter that absorbed Hurricane Grace and ultimately evolved back into a small unnamed hurricane late in its life cycle. The initial area of low pressure developed off Atlantic Canada on October 29. Forced southward by a ridge to its north, it reached its peak intensity as a large and powerful cyclone. The storm lashed the east coast of the United States with high waves and coastal flooding before turning to the southwest and weakening. Moving over warmer waters, the system transitioned into a subtropical cyclone before becoming a tropical storm. It executed a loop off the Mid-Atlantic states and turned toward the northeast. On November 1 the system evolved into a full-fledged hurricane with peak winds of 75 miles per hour (120 km/h), although the National Hurricane Center left it unnamed to avoid confusion amid media interest in the predecessor extratropical storm. It later received the name ""the Perfect Storm"" (playing off the common expression) after a conversation between Boston National Weather Service forecaster Robert Case and author Sebastian Junger. The system was the fourth hurricane and final tropical cyclone in the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. The tropical system weakened, striking Nova Scotia as a tropical storm bef","Paragraph: Hurricane Norbert (2008)
