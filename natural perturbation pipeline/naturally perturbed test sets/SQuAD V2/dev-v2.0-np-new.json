Steam engines remained the dominant source of power until the early 20th century, when advances in the design of electric motors and internal combustion engines gradually resulted in the replacement of reciprocating (piston) steam engines, with shipping in the 20th-century relying upon the steam turbine."}, {"qas": [{"question": "The use of what device represented the last major evolution of the steam engine?", "id": "571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5a", "answers": [{"text": "steam turbines", "answer_start": 68}, {"text": "steam turbines", "answer_start": 68}, {"text": "steam turbines", "answer_start": 68}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what part of the 19th century were steam turbines introduced?", "id": "571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5b", "answers": [{"text": "late", "answer_start": 99}, {"text": "late part", "answer_start": 99}, {"text": "late", "answer_start": 99}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Above what horsepower are steam turbines usually more efficient than steam engines that use reciprocating pistons?", "id": "571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5c", "answers": [{"text": "several hundred", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "several hundred horsepower", "answer_start": 238}, {"text": "several hundred", "answer_start": 238}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Most power of what sort is generated by steam turbines today?", "id": "571142b3a58dae1900cd6d5e", "answers": [{"text": "electric", "answer_start": 624}, {"text": "electric", "answer_start": 624}, {"text": "electric", "answer_start": 624}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "steam turbines", "answer_start": 68}], "question": "What device's use represented the last major evolution of the generator?", "id": "5ad3d3af604f3c001a3ff293", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "late", "answer_start": 99}], "question": "In what part of the 19th century where generators introduced?

In the compound engine, high-pressure steam from the boiler expands in a high-pressure (HP) cylinder and then enters one or more subsequent lower-pressure (LP) cylinders. The complete expansion of the steam now occurs across multiple cylinders and as less expansion now occurs in each cylinder less heat is lost by the steam in each. This reduces the magnitude of cylinder heating and cooling, increasing the efficiency of the engine. By staging the expansion in multiple cylinders, variations of torque can be reduced.

The world price, which had peaked during the 1979 energy crisis at nearly $40 per barrel, decreased during the 1980s to less than $10 per barrel. Adjusted for inflation, oil briefly fell back to pre-1973 levels. This \"sale\" price was a windfall for oil-importing nations, both developing and developed. During the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-1988, the stated war aim of Iran was to overthrow the Baath regime in Iraq and then overthrow the House of Saud in Saudi Arabia. As a consequence, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab Gulf states leaned in a very pro-Iraqi neutrality during the war. As a part of its policy of supporting Iraq, Saudi Arabia pumped out oil in massive quantities to lower the price as a way of hurting Iran's economy. Iran's revenue from the sale of oil went from $20 billion US dollar per year in 1982 to $5 billion US dollars per year by 1988, which pushed Iran to the verge of bankruptcy and forced Iran to finally make peace with Iraq later in 1988.

Members of the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and the lobate Bolinopsis often reach high population densities at the same place and time because they specialize in different types of prey: Pleurobrachia's long tentacles mainly capture relatively strong swimmers such as adult copepods, while Bolinopsis generally feeds on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Why was it thought that  ctenophores were a poor diet for other animals?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33c", "answers": [{"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 92}, {"text": "low ratio of organic matter to salt and water", "answer_start": 98}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the oncorhynchus also called?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33d", "answers": [{"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 386}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 386}, {"text": "chum salmon", "answer_start": 386}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do beroids typically eat?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33e", "answers": [{"text": "ctenophores", "answer_start": 239}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 612}, {"text": "other ctenophores", "answer_start": 612}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where have herbivorous fishes been seen feeding on gelatinous zooplankton?", "id": "57268a37f1498d1400e8e33f", "answers": [{"text": "the Red Sea", "answer_start": 1088}, {"text": "the Red Sea", "answer_start": 1088}, {"text": "blooms in the Red Sea", "answer_start": 1078}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the guts of possible predators", "answer_start": 254}], "question": "Where is it hard to identify the remains of salmon in?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "20 times as fast", "answer_start": 460}], "question": "How quickly do shrimp digest ctenophores as compared to other prey?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "good", "answer_start": 543}], "question": "What kind of diet can salmon provide to other predators?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7fe", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ctenophore", "answer_start": 734}], "question": "What kind of populations can be wiped out temporarily by shrimp?", "id": "5a8397d0e60761001a2eb7ff", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Ctenophores used to be regarded as \"dead ends\" in marine food chains because it was thought their low ratio of organic matter to salt and water made them a poor diet for other animals. It is also often difficult to identify the remains of ctenophores in the guts of possible predators, although the combs sometimes remain intact long enough to provide a clue. Detailed investigation of chum salmon, Oncorhynchus keta, showed that these fish digest ctenophores 20 times as fast as an equal weight of shrimps, and that ctenophores can provide a good diet if there are enough of them around. Beroids prey mainly on other ctenophores. Some jellyfish and turtles eat large quantities of ctenophores, and jellyfish may temporarily wipe out ctenophore populations. Since ctenophores and jellyfish often have large seasonal variations in population, most fish that prey on them are generalists and may have a greater effect on populations than the specialist jelly-eaters. This is underlined by an observation of herbivorous fishes deliberately feeding on gelatinous zooplankton during blooms in the Red Sea. The larvae of some sea anemones are parasites on ctenophores, as are the larvae of some flatworms that parasitize fish when they reach adulthood."}]}, {"title": "Fresno,_California", "paragraphs": [{"qas": [{"question": "The Central Pacific Railroad established a station for its new line in what year?", "id": "5725cfd0271a42140099d225", "answers": [{"text": "1872", "answer_start": 3}, {"text": "1872", "answer_start": 3}, {"text": "1872", "answer_start": 3}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What were the reasons why residents moved to the town of Fresno Station?", "id": "5725cfd0271a42140099d226", "answers": [{"text": "the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding", "answer_start": 299}, {"text": "drawn by the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding", "answer_start": 290}, {"text": "the convenience of the railroad and worried about flooding", "answer_start": 299}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what year did Fresno become an incorporated city?", "id": "5725cfd0271a42140099d227", "answers": [{"text": "1885", "answer_start": 425}, {"text": "1885", "answer_start": 425}, {"text": "1885", "answer_start": 425}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many streetcars did the Fresno Traction Company operate in 1931?", "id": "5725cfd0271a42140099d228", "answers": [{"text": "47 streetcars", "answer_start": 476}, {"text": "47", "answer_start": 476}, {"text": "47", "answer_start": 476}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What entity sparked the growth of Fresno Station?", "id": "5725cfd0271a42140099d229", "answers": [{"text": "store", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "store", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "store", "answer_start": 166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1872", "answer_start": 3}], "question": "When was the Central Pacific Railroad founded?", "id": "5a7b05cd21c2de001afe9cd8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1885", "answer_start": 425}], "question": "When did Millerton residents move out of Fresno?", "id": "5a7b05cd21c2de001afe9cd9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "49 miles", "answer_start": 495}], "question": "How long was the Southern Pacific line?", "id": "5a7b05cd21c2de001afe9cda", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1931", "answer_start": 434}], "question": "When did the Fresno Traction Company come to Fresno?", "id": "5a7b05cd21c2de001afe9cdb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Millerton", "answer_start": 269}], "question": "Where did Fresno residents move to during the flooding?", "id": "5a7b05cd21c2de001afe9cdc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In 1872, the Central Pacific Railroad established a station near Easterby's\u2014by now a hugely productive wheat farm\u2014for its new Southern Pacific line.

The Alta Vista Tract, as the land would become known, was mapped by William Stranahan for the Pacific Improvement Corporation, and was officially platted in 1911. The tract's boundaries were Balch Avenue on the south, Cedar Avenue on the east, the rear property line of Platt Avenue (east of Sixth Street) and Platt Avenue (west of Sixth Street) on the north, and First Street on the west.

At the time of its admission to the City, the Alta Vista Tract was uninhabited but landscaped, although the trees had to be watered by tank wagon. In 1914 developers Billings & Meyering acquired the tract, completed street development, provided the last of the necessary municipal improvements including water service, and began marketing the property with fervor. A mere half decade later the tract had 267 homes. This rapid development was no doubt hastened by the Fresno Traction Company right-of-way along Huntington Boulevard, which provided streetcar connections between downtown and the County Hospital."}, {"qas": [{"question": "In which direction does the west side of Fresno neighborhood lie to the 99 freeway?", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005acea0", "answers": [{"text": "southwest", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "southwest", "answer_start": 188}, {"text": "southwest", "answer_start": 188}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The west side of Fresno is the center of which ethnic community?", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005acea1", "answers": [{"text": "African-American", "answer_start": 473}, {"text": "African-American", "answer_start": 473}, {"text": "African-American", "answer_start": 473}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are the two principal Asian-American groups living in the west side neighborhood of Fresno?", "id": "5725edfe38643c19005acea2", "answers": [{"text": "Hmong or Laotian", "answer_start": 605}, {"text": "Hmong or Laotian", "answer_start": 605}, {"text": "Hmong or Laotian", "answer_start": 605}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "41 freeway", "answer_start": 269}], "question": "What is west of the West Side?", "id": "5a7b325021c2de001afe9da8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "99 freeway", "answer_start": 205}], "question": "What divides Downtown Fresno?", "id": "5a7b325021c2de001afe9da9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "African-American", "answer_start": 473}], "question": "What is ethnic community is traditionally found Downtown?", "id": "5a7b325021c2de001afe9daa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Hmong or Laotian", "answer_start": 605}], "question": "What specific groups are found within the Mexican-American population?", "id": "5a7b325021c2de001afe9dab", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city", "answer_start": 121}], "question": "What is significant about the age of Downtown Fresno?", "id": "5a7b325021c2de001afe9dac", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The \"West Side\" of Fresno, also often called \"Southwest Fresno\", Is home of local gangs(Bulldogs,TRG,Scraps,ect.) and is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city.

X.25 provides it via the network layer of the OSI Model, whereas Frame Relay provides it via level two, the data link layer. Another major difference between X.25 and Frame Relay is that X.25 requires a handshake between the communicating parties before any user packets are transmitted. Frame Relay does not define any such handshakes. X.25 does not define any operations inside the packet network. It only operates at the user-network-interface (UNI). Thus, the network provider is free to use any procedure it wishes inside the network. X.25 does specify some limited re-transmission procedures at the UNI, and its link layer protocol (LAPB) provides conventional HDLC-type link management procedures. Frame Relay is a modified version of ISDN's layer two protocol, LAPD and LAPB. As such, its integrity operations pertain only between nodes on a link, not end-to-end. Any retransmissions must be carried out by higher layer protocols. The X.25 UNI protocol is part of the X.25 protocol suite, which consists of the lower three layers of the OSI Model. It was widely used at the UNI for packet switching networks during the 1980s and early 1990s, to provide a standardized interface into and out of packet networks. Some implementations used X.25 within the network as well, but its connection-oriented features made this setup cumbersome and inefficient. Frame relay operates principally at layer two of the OSI Model. However, its address field (the Data Link Connection ID, or DLCI) can be used at the OSI network layer, with a minimum set of procedures. Thus, it rids itself of many X.25 layer 3 encumbrances, but still has the DLCI as an ID beyond a node-to-node layer two link protocol. The simplicity of Frame Relay makes it faster and more efficient than X.25. Because Frame relay is a data link layer protocol, like X.25 it does not define internal network routing operations. For X.25 its packet IDs---the virtual circuit and virtual channel numbers have to be correlated to network addresses. The same is true for Frame Relays DLCI. How this is done is up to the network provider. Frame Relay, by virtue of having no network layer procedures is connection-oriented at layer two, by using the HDLC/LAPD/LAPB Set Asynchronous Balanced Mode (SABM). X.25 connections are typically established for each communication session, but it does have a feature allowing a limited amount of traffic to be passed across the UNI without the connection-oriented handshake. For a while, Frame Relay was used to interconnect LANs across wide area networks. However, X.25 and well as Frame Relay have been supplanted by the Internet Protocol (IP) at the network layer, and the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and or versions of Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) at layer two. A typical configuration is to run IP over ATM or a version of MPLS. <Uyless Black, X.25 and Related Protocols, IEEE Computer Society, 1991> <Uyless Black, Frame Relay Networks, McGraw-Hill, 1998> <Uyless Black, MPLS and Label Switching Networks, Prentice Hall, 2001> < Uyless Black, ATM, Volume I, Prentice Hall, 1995>"}, {"qas": [{"question": " what is Internet2", "id": "5726472bdd62a815002e8042", "answers": [{"text": "a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government", "answer_start": 13}, {"text": "a not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium led by members from the research and education communities, industry, and government", "answer_start": 13}, {"text": "not-for-profit United States computer networking consortium", "answer_start": 15}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did internet2 partner with", "id": "5726472bdd62a815002e8043", "answers": [{"text": "The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest", "answer_start": 161}, {"text": "Qwest", "answer_start": 206}, {"text": "Qwest", "answer_start": 206}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was the first internet2 network named", "id": "5726472bdd62a815002e8044", "answers": [{"text": "Abilene", "answer_start": 255}, {"text": "Abilene", "answer_start": 255}, {"text": "Abilene", "answer_start": 255}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who did internet2 partner with ", "id": "5726472bdd62a815002e8045", "answers": [{"text": "a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network", "answer_start": 368}, {"text": "Level 3 Communications", "answer_start": 387}, {"text": "Qwest", "answer_start": 206}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "ableine was retired and the new platform is called ", "id": "5726472bdd62a815002e8046", "answers": [{"text": "Internet2 officially retired Abilene and now refers to its new, higher capacity network as the Internet2 Network", "answer_start": 515}, {"text": "Internet2 Network", "answer_start": 229}, {"text": "Internet2 Network", "answer_start": 229}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "research and education communities, industry, and government", "answer_start": 99}], "question": "Qwest partnered with who to help create Internet2?", "id": "5a55242b134fea001a0e197e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a brand new nationwide network", "answer_start": 420}], "question": "Level 3 communications launched what?

The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive feeding behaviour by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance.

Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \"antiforms\", or where it buckles downwards, creating \"synforms\". If the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively.

Continual motion along the fault maintains the topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create accommodation space for the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity. Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long, planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano."}, {"qas": [{"question": "The Hawaiian Islands are made up almost entirely of what?", "id": "57267640f1498d1400e8e074", "answers": [{"text": "layered basaltic lava flows", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "layered basaltic lava flows", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "layered basaltic lava flows", "answer_start": 182}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the oldest known rock in the world?", "id": "57267640f1498d1400e8e075", "answers": [{"text": "Acasta gneiss", "answer_start": 644}, {"text": "Acasta gneiss", "answer_start": 644}, {"text": "Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada", "answer_start": 644}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of rock is found at the Grand Canyon?", "id": "57267640f1498d1400e8e076", "answers": [{"text": "sedimentary rocks", "answer_start": 365}, {"text": "sedimentary", "answer_start": 215}, {"text": "sedimentary", "answer_start": 215}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The rocks at the Grand Canyon have been in place since when?", "id": "57267640f1498d1400e8e077", "answers": [{"text": "Cambrian time", "answer_start": 417}, {"text": "Cambrian time", "answer_start": 417}, {"text": "Cambrian time", "answer_start": 417}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where is the oldest known rock in the world located?", "id": "57267640f1498d1400e8e078", "answers": [{"text": "Slave craton in northwestern Canada", "answer_start": 665}, {"text": "Canada", "answer_start": 694}, {"text": "northwestern Canada", "answer_start": 681}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks", "answer_start": 337}], "question": "What is Hawaii made of that has existed since Cambrian time?", "id": "5a580429770dc0001aeeff46", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded", "answer_start": 558}], "question": "What has happened to sedimentary, volcanic and intrusive rock in the Grand Canyon?", "id": "5a580429770dc0001aeeff47", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "have been metamorphosed", "answer_start": 558}], "question": "What has happened to the the rock in the Grand Canyon that is the oldest rock in the world?", "id": "5a580429770dc0001aeeff48", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "their origin", "answer_start": 780}], "question": "What is hard to find about the origin of Grand Canyon rock unless analyzed in a lab?", "id": "5a580429770dc0001aeeff49", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton", "answer_start": 640}], "question": "What area in northwestern Canada has almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rock?", "id": "5a580429770dc0001aeeff4a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Acasta gneiss", "answer_start": 644}], "question": "What is the youngest rock to metamorphosize?", "id": "5a5915043e1742001a15cf6a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "since Cambrian time", "answer_start": 411}], "question": "How long have the intrusive rocks in the southwestern US been around?", "id": "5a5915043e1742001a15cf6b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks", "answer_start": 344}], "question": "What is the Grand Canyon not an example of?", "id": "5a5915043e1742001a15cf6c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "basaltic lava flows", "answer_start": 190}], "question": "What is complex about the layering of the Hawaiian islands?", "id": "5a5915043e1742001a15cf6d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed", "answer_start": 986}], "question": "What was formed after the undeformed units were deposited?", "id": "5a5915043e1742001a15cf6e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily occur in a single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is indiscernible without laboratory analysis. In addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited.

There is much debate on this point, as some believe that it is a civil disobedient's duty to submit to the punishment prescribed by law, while others believe that defending oneself in court will increase the possibility of changing the unjust law. It has also been argued that either choice is compatible with the spirit of civil disobedience. ACT-UP's Civil Disobedience Training handbook states that a civil disobedient who pleads guilty is essentially stating, \"Yes, I committed the act of which you accuse me. I don't deny it; in fact, I am proud of it. I feel I did the right thing by violating this particular law; I am guilty as charged,\" but that pleading not guilty sends a message of, \"Guilt implies wrong-doing. I feel I have done no wrong. I may have violated some specific laws, but I am guilty of doing no wrong. I therefore plead not guilty.\" A plea of no contest is sometimes regarded as a compromise between the two. One defendant accused of illegally protesting nuclear power, when asked to enter his plea, stated, \"I plead for the beauty that surrounds us\"; this is known as a \"creative plea,\" and will usually be interpreted as a plea of not guilty.

Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Taylor Coleridge.

He found that inequality is associated with higher levels of redistributive taxation, which is associated with lower levels of growth from reductions in private savings and investment.

The Tran dynasty originated from the Fujian region of China as did the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao who recorded the Mongol invasion and referred to them as \"Northern bandits\".

Eicosanoids include prostaglandins that produce fever and the dilation of blood vessels associated with inflammation, and leukotrienes that attract certain white blood cells (leukocytes).

Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis.

Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin during sleep times could actively counteract free radical production during this time. |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study |title=Sleep\u2019s Effects On Your Immune System Revealed In New Body Clock Study"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does a T cell extend when it encounters a foreign pathogen?", "id": "572a058aaf94a219006aa751", "answers": [{"text": "a vitamin D receptor", "answer_start": 56}, {"text": "extends a vitamin D receptor", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "vitamin D receptor", "answer_start": 58}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the active form of vitamin D known as?", "id": "572a058aaf94a219006aa752", "answers": [{"text": "calcitriol", "answer_start": 202}, {"text": "calcitriol", "answer_start": 202}, {"text": "steroid hormone calcitriol", "answer_start": 186}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the nature of the relationship between T-cells and vitamin D?", "id": "572a058aaf94a219006aa753", "answers": [{"text": "symbiotic relationship", "answer_start": 229}, {"text": "symbiotic", "answer_start": 229}, {"text": "symbiotic relationship", "answer_start": 229}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What gene is responsible for converting calcidiol into calcitriol?", "id": "572a058aaf94a219006aa754", "answers": [{"text": "gene CYP27B1", "answer_start": 434}, {"text": "CYP27B1", "answer_start": 439}, {"text": "gene CYP27B1", "answer_start": 434}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Other than T cells, what other immune cells express CYP27B1?", "id": "572a058aaf94a219006aa755", "answers": [{"text": "dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages", "answer_start": 768}, {"text": "dendritic cells, keratinocytes and macrophages", "answer_start": 768}, {"text": "dendritic cells", "answer_start": 768}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "extends a vitamin D receptor", "answer_start": 48}], "question": "What does a pathogen do when it encounters a T-cell?", "id": "5ad4e7eb5b96ef001a10a5f4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "T-cell", "answer_start": 7}], "question": "What cell binds to vitamin C?", "id": "5ad4e7eb5b96ef001a10a5f5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "vitamin D", "answer_start": 58}], "question": "What vitamin do T-cells have a parasitic relationship with?", "id": "5ad4e7eb5b96ef001a10a5f6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "CYP27B1", "answer_start": 439}], "question": "What gene is expressed by the B-cell?", "id": "5ad4e7eb5b96ef001a10a5f7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "CYP27B1", "answer_start": 439}], "question": "What gene converts calcitriol into calcidiol?", "id": "5ad4e7eb5b96ef001a10a5f8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "When a T-cell encounters a foreign pathogen, it extends a vitamin D receptor.

A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What kind of amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155223", "answers": [{"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}, {"text": "hydrophilic", "answer_start": 749}, {"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the study of proteins involved in immune response known as?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155224", "answers": [{"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1247}, {"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1247}, {"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1247}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "There is a public database of epitopes for pathogens known to be recognizable by what cells?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155225", "answers": [{"text": "B cells", "answer_start": 1132}, {"text": "B", "answer_start": 1132}, {"text": "B cells", "answer_start": 1132}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the field of studying immunogenicity through bioinformatics known as?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155226", "answers": [{"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1228}, {"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1228}, {"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1228}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "neutralizing", "answer_start": 37}], "question": "What kind of immune response do smaller drugs provoke?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a758", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "limits the effectiveness", "answer_start": 147}], "question": "What does the neutralizing immune response mean for drugs based on smaller peptides and proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a759", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Computational methods", "answer_start": 406}], "question": "What is not a way that is used to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}], "question": "What is underrepresented in epitope regions?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1247}], "question": "What is the study of small sets of proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses.

Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics.

After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on. This produces a catalytic cascade that amplifies the initial signal by controlled positive feedback. The cascade results in the production of peptides that attract immune cells, increase vascular permeability, and opsonize (coat) the surface of a pathogen, marking it for destruction.

The uniqueness in this theorem requires excluding 1 as a prime because one can include arbitrarily many instances of 1 in any factorization, e.g., 3, 1 \u00b7 3, 1 \u00b7 1 \u00b7 3, etc. are all valid factorizations of 3."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the name of the supposition that any number larger than 2 can be represented as the sum of two primes?", "id": "5729727baf94a219006aa437", "answers": [{"text": "Goldbach's conjecture", "answer_start": 70}, {"text": "Goldbach's conjecture", "answer_start": 70}, {"text": "Goldbach's conjecture", "answer_start": 70}, {"text": "Goldbach's conjecture", "answer_start": 70}, {"text": "Goldbach's conjecture", "answer_start": 70}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of the supposition that there are infinite pairs of primes whose difference is 2?", "id": "5729727baf94a219006aa438", "answers": [{"text": "the twin prime conjecture", "answer_start": 178}, {"text": "twin prime conjecture", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "twin prime conjecture", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "twin prime conjecture", "answer_start": 182}, {"text": "twin prime conjecture", "answer_start": 182}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Besides the analytic property of numbers, what other property of numbers does number theory focus on?", "id": "5729727baf94a219006aa439", "answers": [{"text": "algebraic aspects", "answer_start": 384}, {"text": "algebraic", "answer_start": 384}, {"text": "algebraic", "answer_start": 384}, {"text": "algebraic", "answer_start": 384}, {"text": "algebraic aspects", "answer_start": 384}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the application of prime numbers used in information technology which utilizes the fact that factoring very large prime numbers is very challenging?", "id": "5729727baf94a219006aa43a", "answers": [{"text": "public-key cryptography", "answer_start": 485}, {"text": "public-key cryptography", "answer_start": 485}, {"text": "public-key cryptography", "answer_start": 485}, {"text": "cryptography", "answer_start": 496}, {"text": "public-key cryptography", "answer_start": 485}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the name of one algebraic generalization prime numbers have inspired?", "id": "5729727baf94a219006aa43b", "answers": [{"text": "prime ideals", "answer_start": 685}, {"text": "prime elements", "answer_start": 666}, {"text": "prime elements", "answer_start": 666}, {"text": "prime elements", "answer_start": 666}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Goldbach's conjecture", "answer_start": 70}], "question": "What is the name of the supposition that any number larger than 1 can be represented as the sum of two primes?", "id": "5a89150d3b2508001a72a4a8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "the twin prime conjecture", "answer_start": 178}], "question": "What is the name of the supposition that there are infinite pairs of primes whose difference is prime?", "id": "5a89150d3b2508001a72a4a9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "algebraic aspects", "answer_start": 384}], "question": "Besides the analytic property of Goldbach's conjecture, what other property of Goldbach's conjecture does number theory focus on?", "id": "5a89150d3b2508001a72a4aa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "public-key cryptography", "answer_start": 485}], "question": "What is the application of prime numbers used in information technology which utilizes the fact that factoring very large prime numbers is expressed in the sum of two primes?", "id": "5a89150d3b2508001a72a4ab", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "prime ideals", "answer_start": 685}], "question": "What is the name of one algebraic generalization Goldbach's conjecture has inspired?", "id": "5a89150d3b2508001a72a4ac", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Many questions regarding prime numbers remain unsolved.

Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations. Few colonies remain remote from their mother country. Thus, most will eventually establish a separate nationality or remain under complete control of their mother colony. http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/hobson-imperialism-a-study"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Where was Friedrich Ratzel born?", "id": "573088da069b53140083216b", "answers": [{"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 317}, {"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 317}, {"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 317}, {"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 317}, {"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 317}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was Halford Mackinder born?", "id": "573088da069b53140083216c", "answers": [{"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 350}, {"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 350}, {"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 350}, {"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 350}, {"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 350}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Halford Mackinder and Friedrich Ratzel where what kind of geographers?", "id": "573088da069b53140083216d", "answers": [{"text": "Political", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "Political", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "Political", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "Political", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "Political", "answer_start": 267}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Friedrich Ratzel thought imperialism was what for the country?", "id": "573088da069b53140083216e", "answers": [{"text": "geographical societies in Europe", "answer_start": 51}, {"text": "necessary for a state\u2019s survival", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "survival", "answer_start": 440}, {"text": "necessary", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "necessary", "answer_start": 416}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How would the geographical societies in Europe support certain travelers?", "id": "573088da069b53140083216f", "answers": [{"text": "fund", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "fund travelers", "answer_start": 121}, {"text": "able to fund travelers", "answer_start": 113}, {"text": "fund", "answer_start": 121}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Germany", "answer_start": 317}], "question": "Where did Friedrich Ratzel work?", "id": "5acff6ea77cf76001a686680", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Britain", "answer_start": 350}], "question": "Where did Halford Mackinder work?", "id": "5acff6ea77cf76001a686681", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Political", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "Halford Mackinder and Friedrich Ratzel where what kind of philosophers?", "id": "5acff6ea77cf76001a686682", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "geographical societies in Europe", "answer_start": 51}], "question": " Friedrich Ratzel thought imperialism was not what for the country?", "id": "5acff6ea77cf76001a686683", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "fund travelers", "answer_start": 121}], "question": "How would the geographical societies in Europe reject certain travelers?", "id": "5acff6ea77cf76001a686684", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries.

The Monument of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising is also situated here. \u0141azienki Park covers an area of 76 ha. The unique character and history of the park is reflected in its landscape architecture (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, cascades, ponds) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and bushes).

With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved for nearly three hundred years.

This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because Horses acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the Horses is desirable, since that Horse would then have only one non-zero component. Orthogonal Horse vectors can be three-dimensional with the third component being at right-angles to the other two."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What can keep an object from moving when it is being pushed on a surface?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed7", "answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "friction", "answer_start": 165}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is generated between a surface and an object that is being pushed?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed8", "answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}, {"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Static friction balances what force when there is no movement of an object on a surface?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51ed9", "answers": [{"text": "applied", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied", "answer_start": 130}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What makes static friction go up or down in responce to contact characteristics between an object and the surface it is on?", "id": "57376df3c3c5551400e51eda", "answers": [{"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}, {"text": "applied force", "answer_start": 130}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a situation where the object does not move", "answer_start": 75}], "question": "Pulling on an object on a frictional surface can result in what?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a429318", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}], "question": "What increases or decreases in response to applied friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "static friction", "answer_start": 158}], "question": "What increases or decreases in response to static friction?", "id": "5ad26a5fd7d075001a42931b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Pushing against an object that rests on a frictional surface can result in a situation where the object does not move because the applied force is opposed by static friction, generated between the object and the table surface.

This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galilei's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.

From the perspective of the object, all motion occurs as if there were no gravitation whatsoever. It is only when observing the motion in a global sense that the curvature of space-time can be observed and the force is inferred from the object's curved path. Thus, the straight line path in space-time is seen as a curved line in space, and it is called the ballistic trajectory of the object. For example, a basketball thrown from the ground moves in a parabola, as it is in a uniform gravitational field. Its space-time trajectory (when the extra ct dimension is added) is almost a straight line, slightly curved (with the radius of curvature of the order of few light-years).

These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on the load is the same no matter how complicated the machine."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What did Newton's mechanics affect?", "id": "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f47", "answers": [{"text": "idealized point particles", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "idealized point particles", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "idealized point particles", "answer_start": 100}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What didn't Newton's mechanics affext?", "id": "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f48", "answers": [{"text": "three-dimensional objects", "answer_start": 138}, {"text": "three-dimensional objects", "answer_start": 138}, {"text": "three-dimensional objects", "answer_start": 138}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In what kind of fluid are pressure differences caused by direction of forces over gradients?", "id": "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f49", "answers": [{"text": "extended", "answer_start": 190}, {"text": "extended", "answer_start": 190}, {"text": "extended", "answer_start": 190}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What may a force on one part of an object affect?", "id": "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f4a", "answers": [{"text": "other parts", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "other parts of an object", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "other parts of an object", "answer_start": 267}, {"text": "other parts of an object", "answer_start": 267}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does matter actually have that Newtonian mechanics doesn't address?", "id": "5737a0acc3c5551400e51f4b", "answers": [{"text": "extended structure", "answer_start": 190}, {"text": "extended structure", "answer_start": 190}, {"text": "extended structure", "answer_start": 190}, {"text": "extended structure and forces that act on one part of an object might affect other parts of an object", "answer_start": 190}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "matter", "answer_start": 179}], "question": "What does not have extended structure?", "id": "5ad286fdd7d075001a429900", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "other parts of an object", "answer_start": 267}], "question": "Forces that act on one part of an object do not act on what?", "id": "5ad286fdd7d075001a429901", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "along the pressure gradients", "answer_start": 594}], "question": "In extended fluids, similarities in pressure result in forces being directed where?", "id": "5ad286fdd7d075001a429902", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Newtonian", "answer_start": 18}], "question": "Whose mechanics affected three dimensional objects?", "id": "5ad286fdd7d075001a429903", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Newton's laws and Newtonian mechanics in general were first developed to describe how forces affect idealized point particles rather than three-dimensional objects.
